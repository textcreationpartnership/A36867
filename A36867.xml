            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>OD having been pleaſed not to ſuffer my heart to be much enamoured with worldly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments &amp; imployes of that nature, whereby I have poſſeſſed my ſoule in quietneſſe and enjoyed more liberty: In acknowledgement of that favour and being perſwaded withall that God hath not weaned me from theſe pleaſures for to
<pb facs="tcp:59867:3"/>ſit ſtill &amp; to be idle: my chiefe ſtudie hath been, according to my poore ability, to bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie my mind and to apply my heart to ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall things, which might both better my ſelfe and others, and make me (if not ſo rich and ſo conſiderable in this life, yet (I am ſure) through God his free mercy) rich and eminent enough in the life to come. Wherefore, in the proſecution of that holy reſolution, after ſeverall Works of this nature which by Gods providence I have given to the publick in the French tongue, and which (I may ſay it truly &amp; without vanity) have not been without fruit: It hath pleaſed the ſame divine Wiſdome to put into my heart to give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Pious Nation, this little Work in their owne language. And foraſmuch as your Honours are of the eminenteſt of the kingdome, and of the maineſt and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Pillars, which, under your moſt Pious and moſt Gratious Soveraigne, uphold both this Church and Common wealth: &amp; furthermore, ſeeing alſo that all the eyes of this floriſhing Nation (grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that aſſured knowledge it hath of your fervent Love to GOD, Loyalty to your
<pb facs="tcp:59867:3"/>PRINCE, and tender affection to your Countrey) are now fixed upon you as upon ſo many <hi>Moſes</hi> ſtanding in the gap be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and Gods threatning judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: I have thought my ſelfe bound in duty (having ſo faire an opportunity as this is) to crowd among the reſt into your preſence, and to ſhew as wel as others, this publick and true teſtimony of my moſt humble reſpects, in preſenting firſt with all humility this poore labour of mine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your Honors, joyntly: being unwilling (ſo long as I finde divers preſidents of the like dedications) to divide and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate thoſe whom GOD and the KING have joyned together: beſeeching you to accept of it; to vouchſafe it your Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, and to beare in its forefront your Honourable Names. I preſume that for the Author his ſake, your Honors will not deny me that favour. And the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it tends to the ſame end that yee aime at, to wit Gods Glory, and the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance of True Religion. For, Moſt Illuſtrious Lords, I have beene an eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſſe above this eighteen years, of that Conſtant Zeale and Exemplary Pietie
<pb facs="tcp:59867:4"/>which is ſo reſplendent in your Honors. And oftentimes being raviſhed in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration to ſee ſuch extraordinary gifts &amp; graces in ſuch great Perſons, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the corruption of the times: I have bleſſed God heartily for it, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Divine Majeſtie to powre more and more upon your Lordſhips, the dew of his heavenly graces unto the end. And indeed, Right Honourable, to conclude this in a word, I can atteſt upon mine owne knowledge of that eighteen yeares ſtanding: that although your Honours doe live here among men, your conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation hath been for the moſt part with God; neglecting no meanes (for all your great and weighty occaſions) to waite and attend upon his ſervice, in his holy Courts and Sanctuaries. But alas, all that I can ſay in that behalfe, is but as a drop of water throwne into the vaſt O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean. And therefore, Right Honorable, I muſt crave leave to ſay no more: and aske pardon that I have ſaid ſo little, and ſo far ſhort of what your Honors deſerve.</p>
            <p>As for the Author and Worke, I ſhould ſay ſomething too, if he and his Workes
<pb facs="tcp:59867:4"/>were not better knowne than I can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe, Yet I will ſay this by the way; that he hath been, is, (and long may hee be) one of the Worthieſt and moſt powerfull Inſtruments in Gods hand for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of Soules, deſtruction of <hi>Babel,</hi> and rearing up of <hi>Bethel;</hi> as this Age hath afforded. And for this particular Worke of his, it ſhall ſuffice me to ſay (to give it the higheſt commendation I can) that it is <hi>Peter du Moulins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Finally, Right Honourable, I ſhould ſay ſomething alſo touching my ſelfe: which ſhall bee onely to beſeech againe your Lordſhips to be pleaſed to Pardon the boldneſſe of a poore ſtranger, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicating this ſmall book, and firſt fruits of his (that have ſeene the light in the Engliſh tongue) unto your Honours: excuſe the defects that may be found in the ſame, (though I hope you ſhall finde it faithfully tranſlated, and free from any groſſe barbariſmes in the Language:) and to attribute that exceſſe of teme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, to the exceſſe of the honour I beare unto your Lordſhips: for whom I ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ceaſe to call upon God for an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
<pb facs="tcp:59867:5"/>of Honor and long Proſperity here on Earth, untill that being full of dayes, and having finiſhed your courſe in his feare, yee receive that Crowne of glory which is laid up for you in Heaven.</p>
            <p>And ſo, fearing to be too tedious and troubleſome unto your Honours: I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly take my leave and reſt,</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Foure and thirty contrarieties between the Lords holy Supper and the Maſſe; and how farre the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is departed from the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Lord.</head>
               <p>NOne can deny but that our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus did inſtitute the holy Supper a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right and as it ought: And it were an impiety to find fault with his inſtitution. Therefore the ſhorteſt way, yea the only meanes to end all our differences, would be to come back to Chriſts inſtitution, and to ſpeake as he ſpake, and to doe as he did. That is the thing which we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and beg with ſo much earneſtneſſe, and whereunto the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> can by no meanes agree. For the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> in the XXII Seſſion denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth <hi>Anathema</hi> on all thoſe that ſhall ſay that in the Canon of the Maſſe there is any errour. Yet nevertheleſſe it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident that the Maſſe is nothing elſe but a changing and a diſfiguring of the Lords Inſtitution. Whereof we will give ſome examples.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Chriſt inſtituting the holy Supper
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59867:11"/>among his Diſciples, ſpake in a knowne and intelligible tongue to the aſſiſtants. On the contrary, the Prieſt in the Maſſe ſpeaketh in a tongue which the people underſtand not.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Chriſt preſenting the Cup to his Diſciples, ſaid, <hi>Drinke ye all of it.</hi> And S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> in the 1 to the Cor. Chap. 11. verſ. 28. bids the people of <hi>Corinth</hi> to drink of the cup, ſaying, <hi>Let a man examine himſelfe, and ſo let him eate of that bread, and drink of that cup.</hi> And in the 10. Chap. 17. Verſe, <hi>We are all partakers of one bread, and of one cup:</hi> according to the Verſion of the Romane Church, ſolely authoriſed by the Councell of <hi>Trent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Chriſt in celebrating the Euchariſt, ſpake not of ſacrificing his body, and made no offering unto God his Father. On the contrary, the Prieſt in the Maſſe pretends to ſacrifice Chriſts body, and offereth him up to God in ſacrifice pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatory for the quick and for the dead, without a warrant, and without Gods command.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Chriſt in the holy Supper made no elevation of the hoſte, as likewiſe the Apoſtle worſhipped not the Sacrament, but ſat ſtill at the Table. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, the Prieſt in the Maſſe lifts up
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59867:11"/>the hoſte, and maketh the people to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Chriſt did not cauſe any bones nor reliques of Saints to be put under the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred table, and did not aske of God the remiſſion of ſinnes through the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of thoſe Saints whoſe reliques were under the table. On the contrary, the Prieſt in the Maſſe, kiſſing the Altar, ſpeakes thus to God,<note n="a" place="margin">Oramus te, Domine, per merita Sanctorum tuorum, quorum reliquiae hic ſunt, &amp; omnium Sanctorum; ut indulge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re digneris omnia pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cata mea</note> 
                  <hi>We pray thee, Lord, through the merits of thy Saints, whoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques are here, that thou wilt vouchſafe to pardon me all my ſinnes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Chriſt ſaid to his Apoſtles, <hi>Take, eate.</hi> On the contrary, in the Romane Church, a great number of private Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are ſayd, at the intention of ſuch as pay for them, without communicants and without aſſiſtants, in which the Prieſt ſaith, <hi>Take, eate:</hi> but there is no body either for to take or for to eate. Yea e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in publick Maſſes, the Prieſt often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times eateth and drinketh alone.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Three Evangeliſts, <hi>viz.</hi> S. <hi>Matth.</hi> in the 26 chapter, S. <hi>Marke</hi> in the 14. Chap. and S. <hi>Luke</hi> in the 22. and S. <hi>Paul</hi> in the eleventh chapter of the firſt to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> teſtifie that Chriſt gave bread to his Diſciples, ſaying, <hi>He tooke bread, and brake it, and gave it.</hi> Now
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59867:12"/>the Sacrament is not given but after the conſecration. Chriſt therefore gave bread after the conſecration. And Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 to the <hi>Corinth.</hi> Chap. 11. Verſe 26.27. and 28. ſaith three ſeverall times that <hi>we eate bread.</hi> And in the 10 Chap. Verſe 16. he ſaith that <hi>wee breake bread.</hi> And in the 20 Chap. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> Verſe 7. it is ſaid that <hi>the Diſciples came together to breake bread.</hi> On the contrary, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> teacheth, that in the Euchariſt no bread is eaten, and that the bread is not broken: but that which the Prieſt breakes in the Maſſe, is the body of Chriſt, which nevertheleſſe cannot be broken.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Chriſt giving that bread, ſaid, <hi>This is my body,</hi> declaring that the bread that he gave, was his body. On the contrary, the Romane Church teacheth that the bread is not the body of Chriſt: But that the bread is no more bread: and that it is tranſubſtantiated into Chriſts body, Now how the bread is Chriſts body, himſelfe teaches it, when he adds that it is his commemoration. Even as in the next line following he ſaith that <hi>the Cup is the New Teſtament,</hi> becauſe it is the ſigne and commemoration of it: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſtile of the Scripture, that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59867:12"/>giveth to the ſignes and memorials the name of the thing which they doe ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and repreſent.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Chriſt called that which was in the cup <hi>the fruit of the Vine,</hi> ſaying, <hi>I will drinke no more of this fruit of the Vine.</hi> On the contrary, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> teacheth that that which is in the cup, is not the fruit of the Vine, but blood. And ſaith that in the Cup is not onely the very blood of Chriſt, but alſo that his Body, and his Soule and his Divinity is there: and that the Body is whole in every drop of the Chalice. Whereupon it followeth (and the Roman Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves it ſo) that Chriſt dranke his fleſh, and ſwallowed downe his owne ſoule and body, and ate himſelfe, and had his head in his mouth.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The Evangeliſts doe record that Chriſt having taken bread, bleſſed it. But according to the Church of <hi>Romes</hi> doctrine, which aboliſheth the ſubſtance of the bread in the Euchariſt, Chriſt did not bleſſe the bread; for, to deſtroy a thing and reduce it to nought, is not to bleſſe it.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Chriſt diſtributing the bread and breaking it, ſpake in the preſent tenſe, ſaying,<note n="b" place="margin">

                  <hi>This is my body which is broken for
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59867:13"/>you.</hi> Whereby it appeareth that by his body, he meant the Sacrament or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration of his body. For Chriſts naturall body cannot be broken. To ſhun the force of this argument, the Latin Verſion of the Romane Church hath corrupted this place, and in ſtead of theſe words, <hi>Which is broken for you,</hi> hath turned <hi>Which ſhall bee delivered for you,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.14. <hi>Quod pro vobis tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>detur.</hi>
                  </note> putting <hi>delivering</hi> for <hi>breaking,</hi> and the future for the preſent. And indeed our Adverſaries are mightily peſtered to tell us what it is that the Prieſt breaketh in the Maſſe. Doth he breake bread? But they ſay that it is no more bread. Doth he breake Chriſts body? But it cannot be broken, and they themſelves ſay that it is whole and entire in the leaſt crum of the hoſte, as big and as large as it was upon the croſſe. Doth he breake the Accidents of bread which moſt frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulouſly they call <hi>ſpecies, viz.</hi> the taſte, the colour, and roundneſſe of the hoſte? But theſe things cannot bee broken. Can a man make peeces of taſte, or of whiteneſſe? None but bodies can bee broken.</p>

The Apoſtle ſaith that it is bread. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſaith that it is not bread. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith that it is bread which we breake. On the contrary, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſaith, that it is fleſh which we doe not breake. The Apoſtle ſaith that this bread is the communion of the body of Chriſt. On the contrary, the Church of of <hi>Rome</hi> ſaith, that this bread is Chriſts body it ſelfe. Behold then a cleare and a plaine expoſition of theſe words, <hi>This is my body:</hi> given by the Apoſtle, to wit, <hi>The bread which I breake, is the communion of my body,</hi> and not that which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> giveth, <hi>viz.

               <p n="15">15.

               <p n="17">17. Chriſt preſenting the cup to his Diſciples, ſaid in the preſent tenſe that it was his blood which is ſhed for many. Where manifeſtly he ſpeaketh of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall, and not of a reall effuſion. For our adverſaries confeſſe that in the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59867:15"/>Maſſe the blood of Chriſt is not ſhed out of the body, and goeth not out of the Veines. He therefore ſpeaketh of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall effuſion, which is reſpective to the real effuſion made upon the croſſe. We aske then, whether the Prieſt in the Maſſe drinketh that blood of Chriſt which came out of his ſide and wounds upon the croſſe. If they anſwer that the Prieſt drinks not that blood of the Lord which iſſued forth of his body upon the croſſe, but that blood which remained in the body, and is there ſtill: thereby they confeſſe that the Prieſt drinks not the ſame blood which Chriſt will have us to drink. For he commands us ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſly to drinke the blood ſhed for us. But if they anſwer, that the Prieſt drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſame blood which the Lord ſhed upon the croſſe, then they preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe raſhly, and without word of God, that that blood which came out of the Lords body, is gotten in againe. All this abuſe comes for lack of conſidering that in the holy Supper, Chriſts body is repreſented unto us, and preſented to our faith, as ſuffering, and broken, and dying, and dead for us, and his blood as ſhed and iſſued out of his body. Whereas on the contrary, the <hi>Romane</hi>

There are ſome Maſſes in which the Letany is rehearſed, which is but a long chaine of prayers unto Saints. In the Maſſe, they bleſſe the Encenſe through the interceſſion of <hi>Michael</hi> the Archangell. The Prieſt askes of God, that he would be pleaſed to command his Angell to take the conſecrated hoſte, and to carry it up to heaven. And for an exceſſe of abuſes, at the offertory of the Maſſe, the Prieſt ſaith he makes that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in honour of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> and of the Saints: As if the holy Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per were inſtituted in honour of the creatures.

               <p>THis change, and ſo horrible a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravation of the inſtitution of the Lord, hath wholy aboliſhed the nature of the Sacrament. For Sacraments are ſacred ſignes.

And in the holy Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, the bread and the wine are the ſignes, but the body and blood of Chriſt are the things ſignified. Even therefore, as if the water were taken away from Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, it would be no more a Sacrament nor Baptiſme: ſo the Euchariſt in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is no more a Sacrament, ſince the ſignes, to wit the bread and wine are aboliſhed: in ſtead of which they put Chriſts naturall body and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59867:21"/>blood, which they call the Sacrament. Wherefore the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth that the Sacrament be worſhipped.<note place="margin">Seſ.

               <p>Moreover, the Sacraments are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted for to make Chriſt come downe to us, but to lift up our hearts to him. Nor for to eate Chriſt with our teeth, but to feed our ſoules and ſtrengthen our faith.</p>
               <p>Againe, by Tranſubſtantiation the conſecration of the Sacrament is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed: and there is nothing in the Maſſe that is conſecrated. The bread is not conſecrated: for they hold that the bread is no more bread. Chriſts body is not conſecrated; for Chriſt cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated by men. Neither can the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of bread and wine be conſecrated. For lines, colours, and taſte, are not the offering which is pretended to be offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto God.

               <p>THis change is gone ſo farre, that Chriſts humane nature, by Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, is wholy deſtroyed and aboliſhed. For the Scripture ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Chriſts humane nature, ſaith, that <hi>he is like unto us in all things,</hi>

                  <hi>ſinne excepted.</hi> But the <hi>Roman</hi> Church gives unto Chriſt a body that is nothing like ours. Whence followeth, that he is no more our brother: ſo that all the glory of the faithfull which conſiſteth in have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a brother who is the eternall Sonne of God, is altogether aboliſhed.</p>
               <p>For the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> forgeth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt a body, which is in many ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall places at one and the ſame time: which is in Heaven and upon ſeverall Altars, but not in the ſpace that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween. From whence followeth, that Chriſts body is ſeparated from it ſelfe, and farre from it ſelfe, and higher and

               <p>The ſame doctrine giveth unto Chriſt an humane body, which is whole in every crumme of the Hoſte, and hath his head and his feet in one and the ſelfe ſame place, and both his eies under one point. Can a man ſay that a body whoſe parts are not one out of the other, and differ not in ſituation, and which taketh and filleth no place, and is more ſpirituall than the very ſpirits themſelves, is a true humane body? And for that cauſe the prieſts of the <hi>Romane</hi> Church ſhave or keep ſhort the beard of their upper lips. For that Church beleeveth that if a Prieſt ſhould dip his muſtachoe in the chalice, the whole body of Chriſt would remaine hang'd at every haire thereof.</p>
               <p>The ſame doctrine forgeth unto Chriſt two bodies of a contrary nature, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which are attributed contradictory things.

               <p>Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the third in the fourth Booke of the Myſteries of the Maſſe, Chapter 16, moveth a very important queſtion. He asketh that if a flux or looſeneſſe takes a Prieſt that hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in his ſtomack but conſecrated hoſtes, what is the matter that comes out of his body?

               <p>Our Adverſaries doe anſwer that when Mice have gnawed or carryed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the conſecrated hoſte, or that a beaſte hath devoured it, Chriſt ſuffereth no paine nor hurt thereby. But they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny but that Chriſt there by is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to laughter, and ſuffers a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ignominie than that of the Croſſe. To be eaten by beaſts and vomited up, and wrapped among vomiting and ſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is a thing more ſhamefull than to be crucified. The <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Pagans</hi> will ſay, Is that the God of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans that could not defend himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Mice, and which is devoured by
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:59867:28"/>Dogs? Certain it is, that God would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver make the glorious body of his Son to be ſubject to ſo many ignominies, without it were very beneficiall and uſefull unto the Church. And yet our Adverſaries cannot tell us what good it doth to our Salvation that Chriſt ſhould be thus carried away by a mouſe, or devoured by brute beaſts.</p>
               <p>Cardinal <hi>Tolet</hi> the Jeſuit, in the ſecond Booke of the Inſtitution of Prieſts, chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter 25. ſaith,<note n="†" place="margin">Poteſt conſecrare Sacerdos multos co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phinos pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis &amp; vini dolium.</note>

               <p>By the ſame doctrine Chriſt is in the power of Prieſts, who make him, and pin him up, and walke him, and may if they will, caſt him into the fire: As <hi>Gabriel Biel</hi> a famous Doctor ſaith, in the firſt Leſſon upon the Canon of the Maſſe:<note n="†" place="margin">

               <p>Moreover, the Prieſt demandeth of God afterward, that he would be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to have theſe gifts and preſents as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable, as he had acceptable the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents of <hi>Abel.</hi> That is to ſay, that Chriſt may be as acceptable unto God, as the beaſts ſacrificed by <hi>Abel.</hi> This prayer is good being ſaid upon the bread and the wine, but being ſaid upon Chriſt, it is altogether blaſphemous.</p>
               <p>Chiefly, this is evident, in that the Prieſt looking upon the conſecrated hoſte and the chalice, ſaith, that<note n="*" place="margin">Per Chriſtum Dominum noſtrum, per quem haec omnia, Domine, ſemper bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na creas, ſanctificas, vivificas, henedicis.</note>

               <p>We have ſeene before, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith foure ſeveral times, that in the Lords Supper, we breake bread and eate bread. To ſhun the force of theſe words, they wreſt them into figures, ſaying that it is not bread that we eate: But that figuratively Chriſts body is called <hi>bread,</hi> becauſe it ſeemes to be ſo. Which thing they know to be falſe: for Chriſts body never ſeemed to be bread. <hi>Item</hi> they ſay that it is called bread, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was bread before the conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Which alſo is falſe. For the Lords body was never bread. To ſuch figures, Rhethorick affords no name.</p>
               <p>They bring indeed for example, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> Rod, which is ſtill called a rod af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it was turned into a Serpent: and the water of the wedding of <hi>Cana,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iohn 2.</note> which is ſtill called water after it was turned into wine. Which are examples making againſt them. For of that rod it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presſly ſaid, that it was <hi>turned into a Serpent, Exod.</hi> 4.3. And of that water it is ſaid in expreſſe termes that <hi>it was tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into wine, John</hi> 2.9. But of the bread of the holy Supper, it is not ſaid that it was converted into fleſh. Of this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent one might have truly ſaid that it
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:59867:42"/>was once a rod: and of this wine, that it was once water, becauſe it was the ſame matter clothed with another forme. But of Chriſts body it cannot be ſayd truely that ever it was bread. The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or ſubſtance of the body of Chriſt, is not the matter of the bread. For Chriſts body is not made of bread, and was never bread.</p>
               <p>Others ſay, that the Apoſtle ſaith not, <hi>When ye eate bread,</hi> but when ye eate <hi>of this bread,</hi> underſtanding by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noune <hi>This,</hi> a ſpirituall and heavenly bread. But they conſider not that the Apoſtle in the firſt to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> Chapter 10, ſaith not <hi>THIS BREAD:</hi> but <hi>the bread that we breake.</hi> And Saint <hi>Luke</hi> in the 20 of the <hi>Acts,</hi> 7 Verſe. <hi>The Diſciples came together to break bread.</hi> There, their Philoſophy fayles them. They muſt alſo learne that when the Scripture taketh this word <hi>Bread</hi> in a ſpirituall ſenſe, it is never oppoſed to the cup: becauſe that when the queſtion is of a ſpirituall foode, to eate and to drinke are but one and the ſame thing. But Saint <hi>Paul</hi> oppoſeth this bread to that cup, ſaying, <hi>Let every man eate of this bread, and drinke of this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>That if any one conſider exactly all the termes which our Adverſaries uſe in this matter, hee ſhall perceive that they be unintelligible figures. They ſay that the Prieſt breaketh the hoſte, and that this hoſte is the body of Chriſt, which nevertheleſſe cannot be broken. They ſay they lift up God, but God cannot be lifted up. They ſay the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated hoſte is round: And that Chriſts body is in the conſecrated hoſte. Whence will follow in good Logick, that the body of Chriſt is round. Which, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, they doe not beleeve. They grant both propoſitions, and deny the concluſion. Which is againſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe.</p>
               <p>And when they ſpeake of drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cup, by drinking, they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand a ſwallowing downe of fleſh and bones, and the Soule of Chriſt with his Divinity.<note place="margin">This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of <hi>Berengari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> is to be found in the 2 Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration at the Cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. <hi>Ego Beren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garius.</hi>

               <p>The Lord in the 12 Chapter of Saint <hi>John,</hi> 8 Verſe, ſaith, <hi>The poore ye have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, but me ye have not alwayes.</hi> And in the 14 Chapter, 3 Verſe. <hi>If I goe, I will come againe,</hi> ſpeaking of his returne at the day of judgement.

               <p>All theſe words are as many lies, if we beleeve the Tranſubſtantiation. For in theſe places Chriſt ſaith that he hath left the world, and is no more in the world, and that we ſhall not have him alwayes. But if we beleeve the Tranſubſtantiation, we muſt ſay Chriſt hath not left the world, but is much more preſent than he was before his aſcenſion. For then he was but in one place at once upon earth, but now they will have him to be preſent upon a million of Altars, in boxes, and in bellies.</p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:59867:44"/>

               <p>They rid themſelves as ill out of the other places. They ſay, that when Chriſt ſaith, <hi>He leaveth the world and is no more in the world,</hi> it muſt be underſtood concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his viſible preſence. So they make without word of God, 2 ſorts of Chriſts preſence, the one viſible, the other invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. And make Chriſt ſay, <hi>I goe away, but I will remaine inviſibly: I leave you, but my body ſhall be alwayes with you.</hi> Now in conſcience, could a man that had Chriſts body and ſoule in his mouth, ſay that
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:59867:44"/>Chriſt is not preſent, under colour that he ſees him not? By the ſame reaſon one may ſay, that a man hath no ſoule, becauſe it is inviſible, and that a man hath left the towne, when he lyeth hid in it.</p>
               <p>What more? Chriſt himſelfe in the 13. of Saint <hi>Marke,</hi> 21. verſe, warnes us that there will come a time in which they ſhall ſay unto us, <hi>Loe, here is Chriſt, or loe he is there:</hi> and forbids us to beleeve it.

This anſwer truly is ridiculous. For, to ſay that Chriſt is in the Sacrament ſacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally preſent, is a thing as abſurd as to ſay that a man which is in a Temple, is there Templarily preſent, and he that is in a Coach, is preſent in it Coacharily.

               </p>
               <p>This Idolatry is prodigious, by which the colour and roundneſſe of the bread are worſhipped with the ſame adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that God is worſhipped with. The <hi>Aegyptians</hi> did ſeeme to have attained to the higheſt degree of Idolatry when they did worſhip <hi>Cats, Onions,</hi> and <hi>Storkes.</hi> But this Idolatry, in worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the accidents of the bread, goes farre beyond them: For theſe things they worſhipped, were ſubſtances and things really exiſting: But theſe acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents without a ſubject, are imaginary things, and which indeed are nothing. The folly of thoſe <hi>Aegyptians</hi> would have beene much greater, if they had worſhipped the colour and the length, and the faces or lowring of a Cat, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out worſhipping the Cat. Adde more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:59867:52"/>that they did not worſhip beaſts and plants as the Soveraigne God: but as having in them ſome ſparkes of the Divinity. But the <hi>Roman</hi> Church wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippeth the accidents of bread with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bread, with a Soveraigne adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and which onely belongeth to God.</p>
               <p>And marke the doctrine of this Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite, who ſaith with approbation of the Examinators prefixed in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front of his booke, that the accidents of the bread doe exiſt in Chriſt after the ſame manner as the humanitie of Chriſt hath no proper ſubſiſtence, but ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in the divine nature. This true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is to unite and conjoyne the round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and colour of the bread with Chriſt with a perſonall union.</p>

                  </gap> more ſtraitly conjoyned with Chriſt, than Chriſt with theſe accidents. And by conſequent even as becauſe of this imaginary union of the body of Chriſt with the accidents of the bread, the things which befall theſe accidents, are alſo attributed unto the body of Chriſt, of which they ſay, it is carryed, and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:59867:52"/>lifted up, and walked up and downe, and ſtolne away, and eaten by mice, and vomited up, and devoured by a beaſt: So by the ſame reaſon becauſe of the ſame union, they muſt ſay that the round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and whiteneſſe of the bread are the Sonne of God, and are borne of the Virgin, and are juſt and without origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall ſinne.</p>
               <p>In all this truely the <hi>Roman</hi> Church ſheweth her ſelfe idolatrous in the laſt degree.

               <p>IF the Scriptures had with our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries any authority, this controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie would ſoone be decided.</p>
               <p>Every action that concernes Gods Service, and ſpecially Adoration, is to be done in Faith, and not with doubts and conjectures, as Saint <hi>James</hi> ſaith, Chapter firſt: <hi>Let him aske in Faith no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wavering:</hi> And Saint <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 14. ſaith <hi>that whatſoever is not of Faith, is ſinne.</hi> And the ſame Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> Chapter 11. <hi>It is impoſſible without Faith to pleaſe God.</hi> Now it is impoſſible that the people of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church ſhould worſhip the <hi>hoſte</hi> of the Maſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>Faith commeth by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and hearing by the word of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:59867:53"/>
               <p>In generall we have the Lords com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement ſaying, <hi>Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him onely ſhalt thou ſerve.</hi> Hee ſpeaketh of the Soveraigne God, Creator and Governour of the World, and not of a God made with words, that is made of bread, ſubject to falling, to be vomited up, and ſtolne away. Certainly, to worſhip ſuch a god as that, is to violate the Commandement of the Law, which ſaith: <hi>Thou ſhalt have no other God before me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In vaine doe they anſwer that Chriſt ought to be worſhipped, ſince hee is God: For, beſides that they preſuppoſe that which is not, to wit, that this bread is tranſubſtantiated into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt, they declare themſelves that in this Sacrament Chriſts body is not onely worſhipped: but alſo the roundneſſe, colour, and ſavour of the bread.</p>
               <p>That if any religious worſhip were to be given to this Sacrament, ſome trace of it would be found in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the holy Supper, and ſome commandement of the Lord: But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther trace nor appearance of that is to be found. But rather we ſee that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles ſate at the table during this acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:59867:54"/>as it appeareth by what is ſaid i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Saint <hi>John</hi> 13.12. that Chriſt <hi>after h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> had taken his garments, he ſate downe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</hi> During which repaſt Saint <hi>John</hi> was leaning on Jeſus boſome, <hi>Verſe</hi> 23. And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> relating the Inſtitution of the Lord, ſaith: <hi>I have received of the Lord that which I delivered unto you.</hi> Since then hee doth not ſpeake of any adoration of the Sacrament, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine hee had not received it of the Lord, and beleeved not that the Church was obliged to worſhip the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>The ordinary ſhift of our Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, is to ſay that the Apoſtles wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped not the conſecrated hoſte, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had Chriſt every day with them, and muſt have beene continually kneeling before him.</p>
               <p>I anſwer that to eate Chriſt with their teeth, and receive him in their mouthes, and ſacrifice him in ſacrifice propitiatory, are actions which were new to the Apoſtles, and which neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily required Adoration. Every Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice is performed in the worſhipping of him to whom the Sacrifice is offered up. Theſe things ſo extraordinary and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable (if they were true) did well
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:59867:54"/>deſerve an extraordinary veneration. Specially in the firſt Inſtitution which was to ſerve for a rule unto the Church, and a patterne to conforme her ſelfe unto.</p>
               <p>And ſince our Adverſaries will have Chriſt in the holy Supper to have eaten himſelfe, he might by the ſame reaſon worſhip himſelfe, and bowe the knee before himſelfe, which is a very merry and recreative conception, and ſutable unto Tranſubſtantiation.</p>
               <p>Whereupon we give our Adverſaries the choice. Will they have Chriſt to have adored the conſecrated hoſte? But it would follow from thence, according to their doctrine, that Chriſt had wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped his owne ſelfe, and that he was holyer than himſelfe. And it is certain that he that worſhippeth, and he that is worſhipped, are two perſons. Will they have Chriſt not to have worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the conſecrated hoſte? But it will follow from thence that the Apoſtles, neither then, nor ſince, never worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped it. For Chriſt ſaying unto them, <hi>Doe this,</hi> commanded them to doe as he had done.</p>
               <p>That if the Lord would have had the Apoſtles to have worſhipped the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:59867:55"/>he would have made an elevation of the hoſte, as was obſerved in al Sacrifices, for to binde the ſacrificers and the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants to the adoration. A thing neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe which Chriſt did not doe: for he offered up nothing to his Father. He did not ſay, <hi>Father receive this obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> But ſayd to his Apoſtles, <hi>Take, Eate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Even in the very time of <hi>Tertullian</hi> and of <hi>Cyprian</hi> (as we ſhall ſee hereafter) the cuſtome of divers Chriſtians, both men and women, was to carry into their houſes the ſacred bread they had received in the Church, to wrap it up in a cloth, and to lock it up at home in a cheſt or cupbord. A manifeſt proofe they worſhipped not the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For would they have permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a woman to take God with her hand, put him up in her pocket, and keepe him locked up cloſe at home?</p>
               <p>Would the Chriſtians have upbraided the Pagans that they worſhipped Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues that could not move themſelves,<note place="margin">See Arnob. lib. <hi>6.</hi> and Lactantius lib. <hi>2.</hi> cap. <hi>2.</hi>

               <p>The ancienteſt forme of celebrating the Euchariſt in the Chriſtian Church, is that which is deſcribed about the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end of the ſecond Apologie of <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> wherein no mention is made of any adoration: No more than in that which is extant in the booke of the <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall Hierarchie</hi> of <hi>Denis,</hi> who is ſurnamed <hi>Areopagite.</hi>

Even very lately there was one put to death at <hi>Loudun,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of <hi>Magicke</hi> by the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſulina</hi> Nunnes that were poſſeſt with the Devill. There be Prieſts Atheiſts &amp; profane, that ſcoffe and jeſt at every thing they doe in the Church. I have knowne diverſe Prieſts, who beeing converted to the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, did confeſſe to have ſung Maſſes for many yeares together againſt their intention, and deteſting in their hearts what they did, and asked forgiveneſſe of God for that they had fought ſo long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their owne conſciences.

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:59867:58"/>theſe Maſſes then no conſecration was made.</p>
               <p>By the ſame doctrine it appeares that the Prieſt doth not know whether he b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>It is an ordinary eaſe which alwaies carries this condition or implicite preſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, that the Prieſt hath done as ought to be done in the Church, which condition needs

                  <hi>It is moſt certaine that the power of conſecrating was committed unto Prieſts, ſo that if they would conſecrate to a bad uſe,</hi> viz: <hi>as for poyſonings, or enchantments, the conſceration never the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſhould have its effect.</hi> By this meanes
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:59867:59"/>Chriſt ſhall be in the power of a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, and ſhall become the ſport or pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtime of the Devill.

               <p>But upon this intention mens conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences are marvelouſly confounded and troubled, and their Doctors know not at what paſſe they be.

And if the Prieſt hath before him a dozen of wafer cakes, and his intention is but to conſecrate ten of them, if theſe Hoſtes come to be mingled together, how ſhall he diſcern the conſecrated ones from thoſe that are not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecrated? How ſhall he diſcern his God from the wafers of common bread? Is it poſſible that Chriſt did not leave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſtians any meanes to know with certainty whether his body be preſent under the <hi>ſpecies,</hi> or whether it be not: leſt they ſhould pollute themſelves with Idolatrie?</p>

It is not full of the body of Chriſt: for they hold that Chriſts

               </p>
               <p n="18">18. From the ſame Doctrine follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that when in the Proceſſion on <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus Chriſti</hi> day two conſecrated hoſtes meet one another and paſſe by one an other, Chriſt incounters himſelfe, and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:59867:65"/>goes to meet with his owne ſelfe. And it is to bee preſumed that theſe <hi>Hoſtes</hi> know one another, and make one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other a mutuall ſalutation, and that if one ſhould come to fall, the other that is not fallen, would looke upon that which is fallen, with great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion.</p>
               <p n="19">19. This is one of the beſt of all, and wherein the Romiſh Doctors en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle themſelves moſt and trouble their braines exceedingly. A time was that they diſputed in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> whether it be in Gods power to make that one body be circumſcriptively in two or in many ſeverall places. As for example, whether God can make that <hi>Philip</hi> be at <hi>Paris</hi> and at <hi>Rome</hi> at one and the ſame time, contained and limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by two ſeverall remote places. But now they hold with a generall conſent that it is poſſible. Among thoſe that have written in theſe our times, I know none but <hi>Vaſquez</hi> that is of another o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion. This thing admitted to be ſo, it will follow that if <hi>Philip</hi> be at <hi>Rome</hi> in the water, and in the fire at <hi>Paris,</hi> he ſhall be both wet and burned at once. If one of his armes be cut off at <hi>Paris,</hi> he ſhall have but one arme at <hi>Paris,</hi> but
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:59867:66"/>at <hi>Rome</hi> he ſhall have two. If hee be kil'd at <hi>Paris,</hi> he ſhall be dead at <hi>Paris,</hi> and living at <hi>Rome:</hi> and perhaps com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Paris,</hi> hee ſhall find himſelfe to be dead, not knowing of it before, and ſhall aſſiſt at his owne funerals. Perhaps that <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> will come to <hi>Rome</hi> to ſee himſelfe, and being arrived there, ſhall not find him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe there becauſe he abſented himſelfe from <hi>Rome.</hi> That if both of them ſet forth on the way for to meet one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, one and the ſame man ſhall goe to meet himſelfe. And having met with himſelfe, how ſhall their noſes jumble themſelves into one? How ſhall a man turne his back to his owne ſelfe? That if <hi>Philip</hi> doth feaſt at <hi>Paris</hi> and faſt at <hi>Rome,</hi> one and the ſelfe ſame man ſhall be both full and empty, fat and leane at the ſame time. That if <hi>Philip</hi> meete with himſelfe upon the way, and that <hi>Philip</hi> embrace <hi>Philip,</hi> it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent they ſhall be two. For every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction is at leaſt betweene two divers things.</p>
               <p n="20">20. That if the body of one and the ſame man may be in a thouſand ſeverall places at one and the ſame time, it may be alſo in a hundred thouſand places,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:59867:66"/>and if in a hundred thouſand, ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in a Million, and ſo ſtill in aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting: ſo that at laſt one mans body ſhall be able to fill up the whole world. Indeed, the plurality of places and the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>biquity</hi> comes all to one. The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and thoſe that put Chriſts body everywhere, is onely in this: the one ſay this body is everywhere, and the other ſay it may be everywhere. Truely the <hi>Roman</hi> Church hath no reaſon to contend with the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>biquitaries</hi> about a thing which ſhe beleeves to be poſſible.</p>
               <p n="21">21. The point in Mathematicks is no quantity, and hath no magnitude, and is indiviſible: To put therefore one and the ſame point in two divers remote places, is to divide the point and to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate it from it ſelfe. That is the thing our Adverſaries doe, putting one body in two ſeverall places. For exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, if <hi>Philip</hi> may be at <hi>Paris</hi> and at <hi>Rome</hi> at one and the ſame time, the point that is in the midſt of the apple of his eye, is the ſame point aſwell at <hi>Rome</hi> as at <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> and yet it is farre from it ſelfe, and ſeparated and divided from it ſelfe.</p>
               <p n="22">22. And ſince Angelicall Spirits are

               <p n="23">23. There is impietie mingled with that. For after the Prieſt hath eaten the hoſte, they hold that Chriſts body is in the Prieſts ſtomack untill the ſpecies by diſgeſtion be deſtroyed. After then that thoſe ſpecies be deſtroyed, the Lords body is no more there, and yet is not gone out of it: (for theſe Doctors ſay it cannot move it ſelfe locally.) Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it muſt follow of neceſſity that this body of Chriſt which was in the Prieſts ſtomack, is turned into nothing. And our Adverſaries cannot tell us whither he is gone, nor what is become of him.</p>

So they put in the Hoſte a taſte of bread, a colour of bread, a roundneſſe of bread without bread. And as Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the third ſaith in his 4 Booke of the Myſteries of the Maſſe, chap. 11.<note n="†" place="margin">Eſt enim hic color &amp; ſapor, cum nihil alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utro ſit co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loratum, aut ſapidu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, quantum aut quale.</note> 
                  <hi>There is here colour and ſavour, quantitie and qualitie, though there be here
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:59867:68"/>nothing ſavory, nothing coloured, nothing that hath quantitie or qualitie.</hi> In ſumme, God hath ſo created ſubſtances, and accidents, that as a created ſubſtance cannot be without accidents, ſo acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents cannot be without a ſubſtance: Theſe things be ſo relative one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as to ſeparate them, is as if one ſhould put a Father without a Sonne, or a Sonne without a Father.</p>
               <p>This error caſts our Adverſaries head-long into many others. For if the Hoſte become dirtie, being fallen into the mire, loe there are accidents that carry a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: and whereas the ſubſtance is the ſubject of accidents, here on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, accidents are the ſubject of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
               <p>None can deny but that Ice is a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: when then the conſecrated cup freezeth, they will have the accidents alone to be frozen, and ſo the accidents are become a Subſtance by a new kind of Tranſubſtantiation, no leſſe prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than the firſt, and which never the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe availeth nothing to our ſalvation.

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:59867:74"/>Chriſtian Church, and that ſo many wonders as our Adverſaries pile up in the Euchariſt, be greatly uſefull and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to the faithfull. Yet when we come to examine what the fruit is that comes from Tranſubſtantiation and from the Sacrifice of the Maſſe, we find they reduce it almoſt to nothing, and make the Maſſe almoſt needleſſe and unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable.</p>
               <p>That appeares as cleare as the day, by comparing it with Baptiſme. For in Baptiſme there is no Tranſubſtantiation made. After theſe words <hi>I baptiſe thee in the name of the Father, &amp;c.</hi> the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter remaines in its owne nature, and is not turned into blood. Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, according to the doctrine of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, Baptiſme is a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times more profitable and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall, and of a more excellent nature, For in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church they hold Baptiſme with water abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to Salvation. But as for the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, our Adverſaries hold that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are ſaved without being partakers thereof: as appeareth by the example of <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> and of the <hi>Theife</hi> crucified with Chriſt our Lord, and of many faithfull people that dye with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:59867:75"/>having partaked thereof, ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of thoſe which the Ancient Church did call Catechumenes.</p>
               <p>Secondly our Adverſaries ſay, that by Baptiſme not onely originall ſinne is pardoned, but even wholly taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, ſo that thoſe which are Baptiſed, have no more originall ſinne, nor no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing (to ſpeake properly) that may be called ſinne. But concerning the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, the <hi>Roman</hi> Church doth not beleeve that it wipes away the vices, nor vicious cuſtomes in ſuch ſort as it may bee ſayd that all thoſe which are made partakers of the Euchariſt, bee without pride, or without co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetoueſneſſe, or without laſcivious luſts.</p>
               <p>The principall is, that our Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries teach that by Baptiſme is remitted and aboliſhed all the guilt and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, both eternall and temporall, of all the ſinnes as well veniall as mortall, committed before Baptiſme. But as for the Euchariſt, they ſay it availeth but againſt venial I ſinnes, which they make to be ſo light, that a man needs not ſo much as to have and contrition or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance for them. <hi>Vaſquez</hi> the Jeſuite:<note n="*" place="margin">

                  <hi>It muſt not be doubted but by the Euchariſt, light ſinnes, which are called veniall, are remitted and forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> which remiſſion <hi>Vaſquez</hi> told us juſt now not to be neceſſary. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> in the ſeventeenth Chapter of his fourth Booke of the Euchariſt, putteth this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong <hi>Luthers</hi> errors, to have ſaid that <hi>the firſt effect of this Sacrament is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of mortall ſinnes.</hi> And about the end of the ſame Chapter: <hi>The whole queſtion is reduced to this article, Whether the Sacrament of the Euchariſt doe conferre the forgiveneſſe of mortall ſinnes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with a mans conſcience is charged, or elſe (for it comes all to one) if for to receive the Communion worthily, it be required that a mans conſcience be not charged with any mortall ſinne: For all Catholicks teach that the Euchariſt remits not ſuch ſinnes wherewith a mans conſcience is loaden, and therefore it is requiſite they ſhould be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged before.</hi> And in the beginning of the eighteenth Chapter: <hi>In this chapter it is not taught that the Euchariſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:59867:76"/>for the remiſſion of ſinnes, but onely for to preſerve ſpirituall life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And though even theſe Doctors were not ſo expreſſe upon this ſubject, Yet the practiſe of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church ſhewes evidently that the Euchariſt and the Maſſe availes nothing for the remiſſion of ſinnes. For he that will receive the communion, muſt be confeſſed before, and after confeſſion he receives of the Prieſt the abſolution and forgiveneſſe of all his ſinnes. Whereupon it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that when a little after he receives the hoſte, there is nothing at all to be pardoned: and that the Euchariſt is a plaiſter for a healed wound, and a remedie for a diſeaſe which is not.</p>
               <p>Of how ſmall efficacy likewiſe the Sacrifice of the Maſſe is in the <hi>Romane</hi> Church, appeares in that they ſing or ſay tenne thouſand Maſſes for to draw one Soule out of Purgatory, and yet after ſo many Maſſes, they doubte ſtill whether that Soule be in Heaven, and are ſtill uncertaine of its condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>They Sacrifice in private Maſſes the body of Chriſt in a corner of a Church, for the eaſing of a ſicke body, or for
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:59867:76"/>the curing of a horſe; but it fals out very often that both man and horſe dye, and that the Prieſt hath created his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator and Sacrificed Chriſt for naught. Whence ariſeth a great occaſion of doubting whether Maſſes ſerve for drawing of Soules out of Purgatory. For if Maſſes cannot obtaine ſo ſmall a thing, what aſſurance have we they ſhall obtaine a greater? ſeeing that no Soule comes out of that Countrey for to thanke thoſe who in cauſing Maſſes to be ſaid, have eaſed it with their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. For theſe private Maſſes are pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſuch as cauſe them to be ſayd at their intention. The Prieſt in his <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento</hi> names none of thoſe for whom nothing was given. Of particular Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes for the Soule of a Beggar, there is no ſpeech of it.

               <p>And ſeeing that our Adverſaries hold
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:59867:77"/>with us that our Saviour Chriſt, ſitting at the right hand of God, maketh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt for all the faithfull: it follows that he makes requeſt alſo for the Soules that are in Purgatory.

Images, which are called ignorant mens Books, accuſtome the People to forget, and be without the Scriptures, which in thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries where the inquiſition raignes, is a Booke altogether unknowne among the People. By Tranſubſtantiation, Prieſts make Chriſt, and have him in their owne power. By Holy-dayes that the Pope ordaines, he rules the Civill Government, cauſing the Shops to be ſhut up, and the Seates of Juſtice and of the Kings Counſell to ceaſe. When the Merchants ſhop ſhutteth, the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie-mens ſhop openeth. For then doe the People goe to gaine Pardons (as they tearme it) and viſit Reliques, and alwayes the Baſon is by. By the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of meates and faſting dayes,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:59867:81"/>the Pope rules the Markets, and bellies, and Kitchins, and Kings and Peoples tables. And the more prohibitions there is, the oftner come they to the Pope and to the Prelates for to have diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The Pope hath made of Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie a Sacrament, that he might take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from the civill Magiſtrates and Judges Secular the right of judging of ſuch cauſes; for it belongs to the Church to judge of Sacraments.</p>
               <p>By Diſpenſations in degrees of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanguinity which in the Word of God hinders the Marriage, the Pope maketh that the Children of Princes (for ſuch diſpenſations are given but to Great ones) are obliged to defend the Popes Authority, if they will be held for le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate. By Annates or firſt fruites of Benefices, and the ſale of Archiepiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Cloakes, the Pope makes an incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible gaine. And there is ſuch a Cloake, for which he drawes above threeſcore thouſand Ducats. By the power which the Pope aſſumes to himſelfe to change the Commandements of God, and to diſpenſe of Vowes and Oathes made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, he exalts himſelfe above God. For hee that can free and exempt men from obeying God and being

               <p>The Invocation of Saints, the Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Reliques, and the Miracles which are ſaid to be wrought at thoſe Reliques, ſerve to build up many Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches &amp; Monaſteries, which are as ſo many props to the Papall Domination. In ſum, all the ſubtilty and policy in the World hath been brought therein. Never was there any Empire built with ſo much craft and cunning. The doctrine which teacheth that Chriſt Jeſus by his death hath delivered us from the guilt and puniſhment of ſinnes before Baptiſme: but as for the ſinnes committed after Baptiſme, that we muſt beare the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for them, either in this life, or in Purgatory: hath clipped Chriſts bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for to make place unto their traffick, and for to give credit to their Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and Maſſes for the dead.

                  <hi>CHAP. XXIII.</hi> Anſwer to the Queſtion made unto us by our Adverſaries, Where was your Religion before <hi>Calvin.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THis demand which every foot is made unto us by our Adverſaries, viz. <hi>Shew us where your Religion was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Calvin,</hi> is altogether injuſt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful. For to keepe us from exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion by the holy Scripture, they amuſe us with humane Hiſtories. For this is not a queſtion of Divinity, but of Hiſtory, wherein God hath not commanded us to be learned and skilfull that wee may bee ſaved: But hath commanded us to be inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his Word. At the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, God ſhall not aske us whether we have beleeved as they did beleeve before <hi>Calvin:</hi> but Saint <hi>Paul</hi> tels us that God ſhall judge us according to his Goſpell, and that men ſhall be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Law of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.12. &amp; 16,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:59867:82"/>That if for to be ſaved it were neceſſary to know the Hiſtory of the ages before <hi>Calvin,</hi> mounting upwards from <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin,</hi> to the Apoſtles time, hardlie one Chriſtian of a thouſand could be ſaved.</p>
               <p>That if the queſtion be touching Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, it is certaine we muſt begin by the Ancienteſt, and that it belongs to our Adverſaries to ſhew where their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was in the time of the Apoſtles, afore they ſpeake of the time before <hi>Calvin.</hi> There they are at a ſtand and driven to a non-plus, and not being able to ſhew their Religion in the Apoſtles writings, they ſend us back to an unwritten word, which depends on the Popes Authority, whom they make judge in his owne cauſe; and make the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> the Soveraigne Judge of her owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per duty.</p>
               <p>The principall is, that the Chriſtian Church is ſubject to the Lawes and to the practice of the Church of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles time, and not to the example of what was done before <hi>Calvin.</hi> Of whom they ſpeake as of the Inventer of our Religion, becauſe he exhorted us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve the holy Scriptures. For <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> gave us not any Lawes. We ſpeake
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:59867:83"/>not of him in our Sermons, we ground not our ſelves upon his authority, we doe not ſay of him what the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſaith of the Pope, to wit that he could not erre. We doe not call our ſelves Calviniſts, as our Adverſaries acknowledge themſelves to be Papiſts, and make glory of that title, as<note n="*" place="margin">Certe nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo ſublimiori gloriae titu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo exornare, nec certius, eos eſſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicos, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrare potuiſſent, quàm eos nuncupare Romanos at<expan>

               <p>This demand is ſo much the more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, as it is made unto us. For when they aske of us where our Religion was before <hi>Calvin,</hi> they preſuppoſe that the Orthodoxe Church ought to be viſible in all ages: Which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaith not, but foretels us of great revolts and falſe Doctors that ſhall teach men to abſtaine from Marriage and from meates which God hath cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated for to be received with thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, 1. <hi>Timoth.</hi> 4.3. It foretels us that all the Earth raviſhed in admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhall goe after the Beaſt, <hi>Revel.</hi> 13, 3. and that when Chriſt ſhall come,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:59867:83"/>hardly ſhall he find faith on the earth, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.8.<note place="margin">2. Theſ. 2. Revel. 17.</note> It tells us of the Sonne of perdition that ſhall bee called God, and ſhall doe wonders: and of the great harlot cloathed with ſcarlet, who ſitteth in the Citty with ſeaven hills, that raigneth over the Kings of the earth, which ſeduceth Kings and makes them drunke, and is made drunke with the blood of the Saints and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. It tells us in the twelfth of the <hi>Revelation</hi> that wings are given to the Church for to flie into the Wilderneſſe, and live there hidden for a time. It warnes us that the broad way where the throng of Peoples paſſeth, leadeth into perdition.</p>
               <p>Which things afford us another conſideration. That is if a Cut-purſe asketh him whom hee hath robbed of his purſe, <hi>Where is thy Purſe?</hi> This theefe addeth ſcoffing and deriſion to his theft. So the Pope, who ſince ſo many ages hath perſecuted to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt the Church of God, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to aboliſh it, addeth to this violence this deriſion and ſcoffing, when he asketh, <hi>Where was your Religion at that time?</hi> For it were rather his part to informe us where hee had put
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:59867:84"/>her himſelfe, and to what paſſe he had reduced her.</p>
               <p>In the meane while, though we are not bound to anſwer to ſuch an abſurd and injuſt a demand, and which doth not at all concerne Religion, and being propounded by men whoſe Religion is new, and that have ſwerved from the Ancient Chriſtian Religion, and who even ſay that the Pope may add unto the Creed new Articles of Faith: Yet we ſay that it is foure or five hundred years agoe ſince the Pope perſecuteth with fire and ſword the Faithfull ones, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there was a great number in <hi>France,</hi> in the <hi>Low countries, England, Germany, Bohemia,</hi> and <hi>Hungaria,</hi> to whom our Adverſaries gave odious nicknames, calling them <hi>Valdenſes, Albigenſes, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domites, Picards,</hi> &amp;c.

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:59867:84"/>People remaines ſtill in <hi>Bohemia, Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garia, Moravia,</hi> and in the Valleys of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grogne, Luzerne, Peruſe, Saint Martin, Pragela, Merindoles,</hi> and <hi>Cabrieres</hi> which Churches have joyned themſelves to ours, ſo ſoone as it pleaſed God to diſplay in <hi>France</hi> and the neighbouring Countries, the Banner of his Goſpell. And the ſudden alteration that hapned in <hi>Luthers</hi> time, ſhewed that <hi>Europe</hi> was full of People that knew the truth, and groaned after a Reformation, which the Pope promiſed alwayes, but would never ſuffer it to come to execution.</p>
               <p>And for to ſpecifie ſome thing touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the age immediatly before <hi>Calvin: Aeneas Sylvius,</hi> who in the yeare 1458. attained to the Popedome, was a capital enemie to the faithfull (of whom in his time <hi>Bohemia</hi> and <hi>Hungaria,</hi> and the neighbouring Countries were full) and was a firebrand of warre for to provoke the Emperours and Popes to perſecute them. Wherefore his teſtimony in this point is the more worthy of credit. This man in his 130 Epiſtle, deſcribeth his journey to <hi>Tabor,</hi> a City in <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,</hi> and the Religion of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, and the Conferences he had with them. <hi>Their ſect</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is peſtilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:59867:85"/>and abhominable, and worthy of the uttermoſt puniſhment. They will not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>to have the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, nor that the Clergie ſhould have any thing in propriety. They pull downe the Images of God and of his Saints. They deny Purgatory. They hold that the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Saints which raigne with Chriſt, availe nothing unto men. They obſerve no holy day but the Lords day and Eaſter. Contemne faſting and the Canonicall Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. They give the Euchariſt under the kindes of bread and wine, even to little Children and to madde men.</hi> When they conſecrate the Sacrament, they ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Lords Prayer, and the words of Conſecration. They change no habits and take not any ornaments. Yea ſome of them are ſo madde as to hold that the very body of Chriſt is not in the Sacrament of the Altar, but that it is onely the repreſentation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: being wandring Sactators of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rengarius</hi> unconverted. Among the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of the Church they admit the Baptiſme, and the Euchariſt, and Marriage, and Orders. <hi>But as for the Sacrament of Penance, they make little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it.

               <p>
                  <hi>Hungaria</hi> at the ſame time was full of Faithfull people holding the ſame beleife. They preſented to the King <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſlaus,</hi> in the yeare of our Lord 1508. their Confeſſion of faith, conformable to ours, defending themſelves againſt an Auſtin Frier that had accuſed them to the King of many errors, namely, for that they did not obey the Pope,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:59867:86"/>called not upon Saints, denied Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, received the Communion in both kinds, and rejected Tranſubſtantiation. Vpon which laſt point, they ſpeak thus: <hi>This Frier writeth that the bread and wine in their naturall ſubſtance are changed into the body and blood of Chriſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">This Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion is to be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d <hi>in Faſciou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo rerum expetenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</hi>

                  <hi>and are changed into Chriſt God and man, ſo that nothing of the ſubſtance of the bread and wine remaineth, but that the onely acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents are meerely upheld by miracle. This Confeſſion of faith hath no foundation in the Lord Chriſt Jeſus his words, who never ſpake one word of the converſion of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</hi> And a little after, <hi>By that is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested that the Primitive Church had this Beleife, and hath confeſſed it, and hath not erred, and did not bowe at this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

               <p>About the ſame time, in the yeare 1520. <hi>Calvin</hi> being yet very young, the Faithfull of <hi>Provence</hi> preſented to the Parliament of <hi>Aix</hi> their Confeſſion of Faith, conformable to ours. Vpon the point of the Sacrament, they ſpeak thus: <hi>We are not entangled with any errors or hereſies condemned by the Ancient Church,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:59867:86"/>and we hold the documents and inſtructions approved by the true Faith. And as for the Sacraments particularly, we have the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments in honour, and beleeve that they be teſtimonies and ſignes by which Gods grace is confirmed and aſſured in our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences. For which cauſe wee beleeve that Baptiſme is a ſigne whereby the purgation that we obtaine by the blood of Jeſus Chriſt, is corroborated, in ſuch ſort that it is the true waſhing of Regeneration and renova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Lords Supper is the ſigne un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which the true Communion of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and blood is given unto us.</hi> And theſe poore Churches were the remainder of the horrible Perſecutions exerciſed by the ſpace of three or foure hundred yeares, by Kings and Princes at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigation of Popes. Which Churches they had defamed with horrible here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, accuſing them to be <hi>Manicheans,</hi> and enemies of Marriage: even as they accuſe us now to be enemies unto the Saints and the bleſſed Virgin, and to beleeve that good workes are not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſalvation, and that we make God Author of ſin.</p>
               <p>A few yeares before, under the raigne of good King <hi>Lewis</hi> the XII. who was called the <hi>Father of the People,</hi> happed a
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:59867:87"/>memorable thing which <hi>Carolus Moli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi> a famous Juriſconſulte reciteth in his Booke of the <hi>French Monarchie.</hi> He ſaith that certaine Cardinals and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates did goe about to ſtirre up and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite this good King to deſtroy and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate the Inhabitants of <hi>Cabrieres</hi> and <hi>Merindoles</hi> in <hi>Provence,</hi> ſaying they were Sorcerers, Inceſtuous perſons, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, condemned already by the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Sea. But this King anſwered that he would condemne no body to death without hearing both ſides, and be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acquainted with the cauſe. And that for that end he ſent one <hi>Adam Fumee,</hi> a Maſter of Requeſt, and <hi>John Parin</hi> a Jacobin Frier, his Confeſſor, for to tranſport themſelves into the place where they lived, and be informed of their Religion. Which they did, and <hi>reported to the King, that among theſe men they had found no Images, nor any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That they had found nothing touching Magicall Artes, whoredomes and other crimes laid upon them. The King underſtanding this, cryed out with a lowde voice, and ſwore that thoſe people were better Chriſtians than hee and his people, and confirmed their
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:59867:87"/>priviledges and immunities.</hi> That fell out about the yeare 1412. <hi>Calvin</hi> ſcarce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing borne.</p>
               <p>Pope <hi>Julius</hi> the ſecond, made warres againſt this King: But the King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated his Armie, and the Emperours, neare the City of <hi>Ravenna:</hi> Aſſembled a Councell at <hi>Piſo</hi> againſt the Pope: Cauſed money to bee coyned with this Inſcription round about. <hi>PER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DAM BABYLONIS NOMEN,</hi> as <hi>Thuanus</hi> relateth in the firſt Booke of his Hiſtory.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP XXV.</hi> Of the corruption and falſification of the Fathers writings: and of the difficultie to underſtand them.</head>
               <p>IN the Allegation of Fathers about our Controverſies we have this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage, that we have them but by the hands of our owne Adverſaries. For all the impreſſions that have been made of them, were made upon the Manuſcripts found in Monaſteries, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by Monkes, who had faire oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie to clip and alter them at their pleaſure, and ſet old titles upon new Bookes made and compoſed by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. It is a hard caſe to one of the parties that goes to Law, when he can make uſe of no other writings but of ſuch as his owne Adverſe party fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:59867:94"/>him with, who hath thruſted in ſuch clauſes as ſeemed good unto him. But it is come to paſſe through the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God, that the moſt part of theſe falſifications are ſo groſſe and ſo palpable, that we have not had much paines to diſcover the falſity of many places and falſe Workes, which are in ſo great number, that if they were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, the Fathers Workes would bee found diminiſhed of a third part. Thoſe among our Adverſaries that are well read in the Fathers, acknowledge the ſame with us, and paſſe condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this point. Reade <hi>Sixtus Senen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> about the end of his fourth Booke, and the Booke of Cardinall <hi>Bellarmin Of Eccleſiaſticall Writers,</hi> where he hath put the Catalogue of the Fathers Works. There ſhall ye wonder to ſee the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Bookes, which he ſaith to be doubtfull or manifeſtly counterfeit. Which cauſes men to doubt of the other Workes, whoſe falſitie is not eaſilie found out.</p>
               <p>For the diſcovering of theſe falſities, we have beene helped by the Catalogue of the Workes of Ancient Writers, which <hi>Photius,</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ople,</hi> who wrote about the yeare of our
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:59867:94"/>Lord 878. hath put into his Librarie. And by <hi>Gennadius,</hi> a Prieſt of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeilles,</hi> that wrote a Booke of the <hi>Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious men,</hi> about the yeare of our Lord 492. <hi>Item</hi> by the diverſity of ſtile. <hi>Item</hi> by certaine places of the Fathers, which are alleadged by <hi>Ivo, Gratian, Burchardus, Lombard, Thomas</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, quite otherwiſe than they bee found in the editions printed in this laſt age. <hi>Item</hi> by other places of the ſame Fathers which ſay the contrary: ſo that one and the ſame Father is oftentimes found to contrarie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Even as the ninth Age was the Age wherein the Decretals of the ancient Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> were forged, under the name of one <hi>Iſidorus Mercator,</hi> which was falſely framed for the grounding of the Papall Monarchy, which with might and maine was a building in that Age: So the eleventh Age, in which <hi>Berengarius,</hi> Archdeacon of <hi>Angiers,</hi> withſtood and impugned ſtoutly and vigorouſly the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of the reall preſence and Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation, was the Age wherein were forged ſundry works in the behalf of that error, and divers clauſes were chopt into the Books of the ancient Fathers. Of this
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:59867:95"/>falſe coyne is the Book attributed to<note n="*" place="margin">Bellar. lib. de Script. Eccleſ. Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Senenſis ſub ſinem libriquart.</note> 
                  <hi>Cyprian, of the Lords Supper,</hi> which all the learned of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge not to be of his making. And the <hi>Cathecheſes Myſtagogicall</hi> of <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> The <hi>Catecheſes</hi> of <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Nyſſe</hi> are indeed his, but horribly corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and full of errors, which the <hi>Roman</hi> Church approves not. There is mention made there of one <hi>Severus</hi> an Heretick, who is poſterior to this <hi>Gregory</hi> above 150. yeares.</p>
               <p>Of theſe falſifications and divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, we have entreated more at large in the Book againſt Cardinal du <hi>Perron.</hi> He that ſhould take away from the works of <hi>Cyprian, Ambroſe, Hierome, Auſtin</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanaſius,</hi> the counterfeit Books, ſhould diminiſh the writings of theſe Fathers more than of a third part.</p>
               <p>Wherefore after ſo many falſities diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, when our adverſaries object us ſome place of a Father, we might very ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtly deſire them to proveunto us that that place was not added or depraved by ſome falſifier aſwell as ſo many others. By all manner of reaſons, if in an writing brought in juſtice there be found but one falſification, the whole inſtrument loſeth all its force and is rejected.</p>
               <pb n="173" facs="tcp:59867:95"/>
               <p>There is another difficulty that decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth ſuch men as are not wel ſeen in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, to wit, that the words uſed in old time, have now changed their ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. In the Fathers are found theſe words, of Pope, of Sacrifice, of Oblation, of Purging fire, of Indulgence, of Station, of Species, of Monke, of Penance; but quite in another ſenſe than theſe words are taken at this day.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding theſe difficulties and diſadvantages, whereby our adverſaries ſtrive to prevaile againſt us, we refuſe not for all that to buckle with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For what falſifications ſoever were made in the Books of Ancient writers, yet in them remaines ſtill ſo many expreſſe and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall places againſt Tranſubſtantiation, that of the collection of them, a man might make a great volume. Wee have produced above 500 in the Book of the <hi>Novelty of Popery;</hi> and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> le <hi>Faucheur,</hi> and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXIX.</hi> That divers Ancient Fathers have beleeved a myſticall Union of the Godhead of Chriſt with the bread of the Sacrament.</head>
               <p>NEvertheleſſe, I cannot deny but that many Fathers have had an opinion, which with good reaſon is rejected by the Roman Church of theſe dayes. They teach that as Chriſts divine nature hath united it ſelfe perſonally unto his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, ſo the ſame divine nature,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:59867:115"/>by vertue of the Conſecration, is united to the bread of the Euchariſt, by an u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, though not perſonall and hypoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall, yet myſticall, divine, and ineffa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, by which the bread remaining bread, is made the body of Chriſt. For they uſe this compariſon, taken from the perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall union of the two natures of Chriſt, for to ſhew how the bread is the body of Chriſt: This opinion hath no founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Scripture. Yet I dare ſay, it is an errour no way prejudiciall to Chriſtian Religion. For that opinion changeth not the nature of Chriſt, and deſtroyes not his humanitie. Neither doth it deſtroy the nature of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſince they did beleeve that the bread changeth not its ſubſtance. Whence alſo they worſhipped not the Sacrament, neither did fall into Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie. To be ſhort, it was an innocent error, ſerving to augment and encreaſe the peoples reſpect and reverence to the holie Sacrament, which for that cauſe they call terrible and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
               <p>In the meane while we have in that a moſt evident proofe that theſe Fathers did not beleeve the Tranſubſtantiation. For as they beleeved not that by the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:59867:116"/>of Chriſts divinitie with his huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, the human nature was tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated, or his bodie aboliſhed: ſo did not they beleeve that by this myſticall and divine union of the God-head of Chriſt with the bread, the bread ſhould be deſtroyed, and turned into another ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>By this doctrine the bread of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt is the body of Chriſt in two man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: the one becauſe of that myſticall union of the bread with Chriſt, after the ſame ſorte as Jeſus Chriſt man is called the Son of God; becauſe of the perſonall union with the Sonne of God: The other, becauſe this bread is the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred ſigne and remembrance of Chriſts body, as it is uſual to give to the ſignes the name of that which they doe ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie. For this ſecond conſideration they ſay that the bread of the Euchariſt is the body which was borne of the Virgin, and crucified for us. For as touching the firſt Conſideration, it is certaine that this bread which they ſay is made Chriſts body by that myſticall union, is another body of Chriſt than that which was crucified for us. For to effect ſuch a tranſmittation, they interpoſe the Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotencie of God. For it muſt bee a
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:59867:116"/>divine power for to cauſe that the bread remaining bread, bee ſo ſtraitly united to the Godhead of Chriſt, as to become the body of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Now, that theſe Fathers doe hold that this myſticall body of Chriſt is another body than that which was crucified for us, though it be the ſame in ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we prooved it juſt now by a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of places of Fathers, wherein they ſay that Chriſt hath two ſorts of fleſh, and that we may very well eate of that fleſh or myſticall body which is taken in the Sacrament, but no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of way eate the fleſh that was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified for us.</p>
               <p>The firſt Father that ever made uſe of the perſonall union of the two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Chriſt for to ſhew how the bread is made the body of Chriſt, not by Tranſubſtantiation, but by the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious union of the Godhead of Chriſt with the bread, is <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the end of his ſecond Apologie, where he ſpeaketh thus: <hi>Wee doe not take theſe things as common bread: but after the ſame manner as Chriſt our Saviour was incarnate and made fleſh and blood for our ſalvation, ſo we have beene taught that the meate whereon thankeſgivings have been
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:59867:117"/>rendred by the prayer of the Word, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by our fleſh is nouriſhed by</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">By this tranſmuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hee underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the change of the bread which is made in the ſtóach for the nouniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</note> 
                  <hi>tranſmutation, is the body and blood of Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Now that <hi>Juſtin</hi> beleeved that this meate is bread ſtil, and hath not loſt its ſubſtance, he ſheweth it when hee ſaith that our bodies are fed with it. And by that which he ſaith in that very place, that <hi>the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons give to all them that are preſent to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate, the bread and wine, whereupon graces have beene ſaid.</hi>

                  <hi>Even as Chriſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>did neither change nor deſtroy the humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but joyned himſelfe unto it: So in the Sacrament he neither deſtroyeth nor chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the ſubſtance of the bread and wine, but joyneth himſelfe unto it in the unity of his body and blood.</hi> For which cauſe alſo <hi>Bellarmin</hi> placeth him among the Impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators.</p>
               <p>This doctrine doth no whit agree with the ubiquity. For they did put this uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt with the bread, in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament only, which bringeth no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of change to the naturall body of Chriſt. But theſe Fathers make two bodies of Chriſt: the one his naturall body, which is but in Heaven, the other the bread of the Sacrament, which they make to be Chriſts body two manner of wayes: to wit becauſe it is united to the divinitie of Chriſt by an union like unto the hypoſtaticall union of the two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Chriſt, and becauſe it is a ſigne, figure, and ſymbole of Chriſts naturall body: according as the ſignes are wont to be called by the name of that which they doe ſignifie and repreſent. Whence
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:59867:120"/>alſo they ſay ſometimes that that bread is the body of Chriſt, borne of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, and crucified for us.</p>
               <p>Whoſoever ſhall apprehend this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, ſhall have a key in their hand for to enter into the knowledge and intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the Fathers, and for to come out of all difficulties. It is the ſolution of the places of <hi>Cyril</hi> that are objected againſt us, and of thoſe and <hi>Ambroſe</hi> out of the Booke of Sacraments. For indeed the Author of the Books of Sacraments was one of theſe Impanators, ſince that he holdeth that by the unſpeakable vertue of God, the bread becometh the body of Chriſt, and yet remaines bread ſtill, as we have prooved, and alleadged the forme of the ſervice of that time, where it was ſaid,<note n="*" place="margin">

                  <hi>That the oblation we offer, is the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of the body of Chriſt.</hi> And in the 4 chap, <hi>Let us eſtabliſh this, to wit, how THAT WHICH IS BREAD, may be the body of Chriſt.</hi> And a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he ſaith that the bread and the wine are ſtill what they were, and yet are changed into the body and blood of the Lord. Wee muſt not wonder if for to work this change in the bread of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, he imployeth the Omnipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God, and his unexpreſſable vertue
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:59867:121"/>in changing things. For indeed if that u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion he conceiveth, were true, it were an unſpeakable and incomprehenſible work, and wherein human reaſon is ſtark blind.</p>
               <p>Becauſe of this myſticall union which is neare unto the perſonall union, <hi>Cyrill</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> ſaith, that this body of Chriſt received into our bodies, maketh them ſuſceptible and capable of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection. Which truely is an abuſe. For by the ſame reaſon the participation of the Sacrament ſhould keep us from dying. The Faithfull of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſte, and the <hi>Theife</hi> crucified with Chriſt, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>infinit number of Martyrs, that were never partakers of this Sacrament, are no leſſe capable of the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>From that impanation ſprung up that cuſtome by which in old time many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſons carried away the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt into their own houſes, and kept it locked up in a cheſt or cupboord, as<note n="a" place="margin">

<pb n="225" facs="tcp:59867:121"/>ſide that ſheweth alſo that they did not beleeve the Tranſubſtantiation. For they would never have put Chriſts natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall body into a womans hand, for to keep it locked up in a cupboord.</p>
               <p>From the ſame opinion proceeded that which <hi>Satyrus</hi>

               <p>Neither is it to bee omitted that the Fathers never ſpeake of the <hi>ſpecies</hi> of the bread in the plurall, but only in the ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, becauſe that by the <hi>ſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It is therefore very wrongfully that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> condemnes thoſe that have put a myſticall and unſpeakable union betweene the Godhead of Chriſt
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:59867:124"/>and the bread of the Sacrament, ſince our Adverſaries themſelves bring in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a thouſand times more abſurde and more pernicious, betweene Chriſt and the Accidents of bread. More ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, I ſay: For the union of two ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances may eaſily be conceived; But to unite a ſubſtance with the accidents of another ſubſtance, as if one ſhould put the Moon under the accidents of a horſe, is a thing and a conceit which paſſeth all the imaginations of hypocondriaks, and which cannot fall into the mind of any man that hath not interdicted to himſelfe the uſe of reaſon. Adde moreover that this doctrine deſtroyeth the nature of the Sacrament, and the humanity of Chriſt, as we have prooved: and bindeth men to worſhip a peece of bread with divine adoration. Things, which the ancient Church never beleeved nor practiſed.</p>
               <p>It ſeemeth that Satan, when he temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Chriſt in the Wilderneſſe, was a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting this doctrine, and making an eſſay or triall of it. For promiſing unto Chriſt imaginary kingdomes, he propoſed unto him accidents without a ſubject. And in ſpeaking to him of turning ſtones into bread, he ſpake to him of a Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation.</p>

               <p n="1">1. THe two third partes of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> are employed in ſpeaking both of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and of the Prieſthood of the Chriſtian Church, where nevertheleſſe no mention is made at all of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, nor of any other Sacrifice of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption than the death of Chriſt our Lord.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Moreover, in many places, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly about the end of the ninth Chapter, the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>As it is appointed unto men once to dye, ſo Chriſt was once offered for to take away our ſinnes.</hi> Teaching us, that as man dieth but once, and that the death of men is not reiterated, neither bloodily nor unbloodily: ſo the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice by which Chriſt offered himſelfe for our ſinnes, receiveth no iteration. And
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:59867:127"/>in the tenth Chapter, two ſeverall times, he ſaith in expreſſe tearmes that Chriſt hath offered <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nicam oblatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem,</hi> one onely Sacrifice, and then ſate him downe on the right hand of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For ſince Chriſts death is a price, and a ſufficient Sacrifice for our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; there is no more need of another Sacrifice of redemption. That if for ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying unto our ſ lves Chriſts Sacrifice he muſt he ſacrificed againe, by the ſame reaſon for to apply his d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="4">4. But how ſhould Chriſt in the Maſſe ſatisfie for our ſinnes, ſeeing he is no more in that condition of ſatiſfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor of ſuffering for us?

               <p n="5">5. Wherefore the Paſtors of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Church, are never called Prieſts in the Scripture, for to diſtinguiſh them from the people.

               <p n="6">6. The Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Epheſians</hi> 4.11. maketh a denumeration of the Offices which Chriſt, aſcending up to heaven, left here to his Church. <hi>And he gave ſome Apoſtles, and ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and ſome Evangeliſts: and ſome Paſtors and Teachers,</hi> Of Prieſts and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificers he ſpeaketh not one word. No more than in the firſt to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and in the Epiſtle to <hi>Titus,</hi> where he deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth the duty of Prieſts (whom hee calleth alſo Biſhops) and of Deacons, without making any mention of this Prieſthood.</p>
               <pb n="238" facs="tcp:59867:128"/>
               <p n="7">7. It is evident that to be a Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, is a thing more excellent than to be Sacrificed. So <hi>Aaron</hi> was more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent than the beaſts that he offered: Not onely becauſe he was a man, and had theſe Sacrifices in his power: but alſo becauſe theſe Lambes and Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks were figures of Chriſt, as hee was a man, who was to die for us: but <hi>Aaron</hi> repreſented Chriſt, as hee was God, offering his body in Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to his Father for our finnes. Prieſts therefore boaſting themſelves of ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing Chriſt, advance themſelves above Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="8">8. In all Sacrifices the thing ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and offered unto God, muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed and killed. But in the Maſſe Chriſt is not deſtroyed and ſuffereth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing there. Therefore in the Maſſe Chriſt is not ſacrificed. To ſay that in the Maſſe Chriſts ſacramentall being is deſtroyed, is a pure mockerie. For Chriſt hath but one being, to wit his naturall being. And this word of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall being,</hi> is as much as a <hi>ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative being,</hi> which is a Chymera o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> fond conceit. The principall is that in the Maſſe they pretend to ſacrifice Chriſt for our redemption. But the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:59867:128"/>or ſignificative being of the Lord is not the price of our rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ption, &amp; is not ſacrificed for us. That if the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice be made when the ſpecies of the bread and wine are deſtroyed, we muſt ſay that the Sacrifice is made in the ſtomach of the Prieſt ſome houres after the Maſſe is ended: for there muſt be ſome time for to deſtroy the <hi>ſpecies</hi> by the diſgeſtion.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Furthermore in all Sacrifices the thing ſacrificed muſt bee Conſecrated, and in every Sacrifice there muſt be ſome Conſecration. But in the Maſſe there is nothing conſecrated. Not the bread, for they hold it is no more bread. Not Chriſts body, for men cannot conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate him: It is he that conſecrateth us. Not the accidents of bread: For they be not offered to God in Sacrifice: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe the Maſſe would be a Sacrifice of accidents, of colour, of ſavor, of lines, and ſuperficies.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Our Adverſaries never find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves more puzled, than when they are put to finde in the inſtitution of this Sacrament, ſome action wherein this Sacrifice doth conſiſt by which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that the conſecrated Hoſte is ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed to God in propitiatory Sacrifice. Doth this Sacrifice conſiſt in the words
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:59867:129"/>whereby the Prieſt preſenteth the body of Chriſt unto God, and prayes him to have that offering acceptable? But we have ſeene in the foregoing Chapter that our Adverſaries doe confeſſe, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Chriſt made not God his Father. Doth this Sacrifice confiſt in the fraction of the bread? But that is impoſſible; for Chriſt brake the bread before hee uttered the words of Conſecration, therefore hee brake no conſecrated Hoſte. And when the Prieſt lets the Hoſt fall whole into the Chalice without breaking it, the Maſſe leaveth not for that to be called a Sacriſice, as <hi>Bellarmin</hi>

Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, in every Sacrifice, he that ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth, addreſſeth himſelfe to God, but theſe words are addreſſed to the broad. Which is more, we have ſeene here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>above the Confeſſion of our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, acknowledging that in all this action Chriſt offered nothing to God. Therefore he made no Sacrifice.</p>
               <p n="11">11. It is to be noted that in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church the Order of Prieſthood is a Sacrament, whoſe it ſtitution they wil have to be found in the Inſtitution of the Euchariſt, when the Lord ſaid, <hi>Doe this,</hi> as if Chriſt by one and the ſame words had inſtituted two Sacraments.

               <p>But they ſhew ſufficiently how they call the holy Supper a Sacrifice, ſince they call it <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> that is to ſay Thankeſgiving, and not a Sacrifice of Propitiation.

               <p>In a word, the Fathers are full of ſuch places. Wherefore in the Euchariſt they put no difference between the Sacrament and the Sacrifice.

               <p>The holy Scripture is full of ſuch manner of ſpeeches, wherein nothing is more frequent than to ſpeake of good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions as of meats and drinks, and of the Graces of God, as of a water that quenſheth the thirſt, and of the deſire of theſe graces as of a hunger and thirſt.

               <p>Here our Adverſaries acknowledge with us, that there is a manner of eating the body of Chriſt which is ſpirituall, and which is done not by the corporall mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>th, but by the Faith in Chriſt Ieſus, in whom we find our life and ſpirituall food. The Councell of <hi>Trente</hi> in the XIII Seſſion, chap. 8. teaches the ſame, ſaying: <hi>Some eate this bread, only ſpiritually and by a lively Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But beſides this ſpirituall manducati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> forgeth to her ſelfe a corporall manducation, whereby the Faithfull in the Euchariſt do chew
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:59867:141"/>and eate with their very teeth the body of our Saviour Chriſt, and take it with the corporall mouth, and make him to enter into their ſtomacks, and do call this a reall and true manducation, for to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it to the ſpirituall manducation, whereof they ſpeake very often with contempt, as of a picture and of a thing which conſiſts only in imagination. The Councell of <hi>Trente</hi> intimates ſo much tacitely, ſaying, there be ſome that eate this bread only ſpiritually, as if it were a ſmall thing in compariſon of the reall eating of it by the mouth of the body.</p>
               <p>Yet nevertheleſſe when wee preſſe them a little, they are forced to avow that the ſpirituall manducation is a great deale better: and that the corporall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation, which they maintaine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend ſo ſtiflly and with ſo much ardour, is a ſmall thing in regard of the ſpirituall. For they confeſſe that many are ſaved without partaking of the Euchariſt, but that none are ſaved without beleeving in Chriſt. And that many eate the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which nevertheleſſe do periſh e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally: but that whoſoever eateth Chriſts fleſh ſpiritually and with true Faith, ſhall have eternall ſalvation, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Lords ſaying in the third
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:59867:142"/>chap. of S. <hi>John,</hi> that <hi>whoſoever beleeveth on him, ſhall not periſh, but have eternall life.</hi> Which is more, our Adverſaries do acknowledge with us, that the manduca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sacrament, without the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall manducation by Faith, is not only unprofitable, but even turnes into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation: and that it is profitable and uſefull, but for, and becauſe of the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall manducation. But the ſpirituall manducation, by it ſelfe alone, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the corporall manducation, leaves not to be profitable, and alwayes neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſalvation. The manducation of the Sacrament, by the mouth of the body, is common both to good and bad, and hypocrites partake thereof as well as the true Faithfull: yea our Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries hold, that beaſts may eate Chriſts body, and that Mice do carry away ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the body of the Lord: But the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall manducation, is proper and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to Gods Children, and none but the true Faithfull can be partakers thereof. Chriſt in the 15 of S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> ſaith: <hi>that which goeth into the mouth, defileth not a man:</hi> whence follows that neither can it ſanctifie a man.</p>
               <p>In this, S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> is far from that lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage which the <hi>Roman</hi> Church holdeth
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:59867:142"/>now a dayes, who acknowledgeth no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther true and reall manducation of Chriſts body, than that which is made by the bodily mouth in the Euchariſt. For this holy man on the contrary, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth that there is no other true and reall manducation of Chriſts body, but the ſpirituall: and that that which is done in the Sacrament by the mouth of the body, is not a true manducation.

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> That in the 6 Chapter of S. Iohn the Lord ſpeakes not of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Euchariſt, nor of the manducation of his fleſh by the mouth of the body.</head>
               <p>BY the corporall manducation, wee underſtand the manducation of the bread and wine, which Chriſt hath hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the title of his body and blood, becauſe they are the Sacrament and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the ſame. But our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries pretend to eate really the body of Chriſt with their mouth, and to make him paſſe into their ſtomach: and for to prop this ſo groſſe and Capernaitiſh manducation, they alleadge the ſixth of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> where Chriſt ſaith that he is the bread come downe from Heaven, and promiſeth to give his fleſh to eate.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For to beleeve that, a man muſt of purpoſe put out his own eyes, and give
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:59867:143"/>the Son of God the lye: For all this d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If by theſe words hee had promiſed to give them the Euchariſt, hee would have deceived them: for he never admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred nor preſented the holy Supper unto them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That appeareth by the time wherein the Lord held this diſcourſe. It was when the holy Supper was not as yet inſtituted: no, nor till about two yeares after. How could the Lords Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples have underſtood that hee ſpake of the Euchariſt unto them, which was not, and whereof he had never ſpoken before?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Where is there in all this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the Lord the leaſt mention of a Table, or of a Chalice; or of a Supper, or of a Fraction of Bread, or of a diſtribution of the Sacrament a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many? In ſumme, of any of the actions wherein the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Sacrament doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt?</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is to be noted that Chriſt ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth often in the preſent tenſe.<note place="margin">Iohn 6.33 and chap 35 &amp; 14.</note> He doth not ſay, <hi>I ſhall be the bread</hi> come downe

               <p n="5">5. Now that by <hi>eating</hi> and <hi>drinking</hi> the Lord meaneth to beleeve and to truſt in him, and thereby to be nouriſhed and vivified: he ſhewes it himſelfe, ſaying in the 35 Verſe, <hi>I am the bread of life; be that commeth to me, ſhall never hunger; and hee that beleeveth on mee, ſhall never thirſt.</hi> Who ſees not that in this place, <hi>beleeving</hi> is put for <hi>drinking,</hi> ſince by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving the thirſt is quenched? And as by that word of <hi>comming</hi> hee ſpeaketh of a ſpirituall comming: ſo by that word, <hi>drinking,</hi> hee meaneth and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeth a kinde of ſpirituall drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And when the Lord ſaith in the 47. and 48 Verſe, <hi>Hee that beleeveth in mee, hath eternall life: I am the bread of life:</hi> who ſees not that this bread is taken in and by beleeving? For Chriſt ſheweth how he is the bread of life, to
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:59867:144"/>wit becauſe he that beleeves on him, hath eternall life.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The very words whereupon our Adverſaries ground themſelves moſt, are thoſe which make moſt againſt them. In the 53 Verſe the Lord ſaith, <hi>Except yee eate the fleſh of the Sonne of man, and drinke his blood, yee have no life in you.</hi> There it is evident he ſpeakes of a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation neceſſary unto ſalvation, and without which none can be ſaved. Hee ſpeakes not therefore of the manduca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sacrament by the mouth of the body, ſeeing that without it ſo many are ſaved. Now to ſay that this corporall manducation is neceſſary, not indeed, but in vow and deſire, is to come neare our beleefe, and reduce that neceſſity to the ſpirituall manducation. Moreover, to ſay that none are ſaved without deſiring to be partakers of the holy Communion, is to exclude from ſalvation, <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, and the good <hi>Theife</hi> crucified with the Lord, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver participated thereof, neither in deed nor in vow. And we might bring many examples of <hi>Pagans</hi> and <hi>Idolaters,</hi>

One may well eate the bread un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>Whoſoever eateth this bread unworthily.</hi> But it is impoſſible to eate the Lords fleſh unworthily, ſince <hi>to eate</hi> is <hi>to beleeve,</hi> as we have ſhewed. A man cannot beleeve in Chriſt unworthily, no more than to
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:59867:145"/>love God unworthily: ſince that in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving in Chriſt, and in loving of God, conſiſteth all our dignity. Cardinall <hi>Cajetan</hi> obſerveth the ſame, upon the ſixt of Saint <hi>John,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Chriſt doth not ſay, He that eateth my fleſh and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth my blood worthily, but hee that eateth and drinketh: to the end wee may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that he ſpeaketh of a meate and of a drinke that hath no need of modifieation, &amp;c.</hi> It appeareth then plainely that this ſpeech is not to be underſtood literally, and that the Lord ſpeaketh not of eating and drinking the Sacrament, but of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving, and of feeding ſpiritually by faith in his death.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The Lord addeth in the 56 Verſe, <hi>He that eateth my fleſh and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me and I in him.</hi> Words that decide this queſtion: For they would be falſe if they ſhould be taken and underſtood of the manducation of the Sacrament: it being a thing moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that profane men and hypocrites which receive the Sacrament, dwell not in Chriſt, nor Chriſt in them. Now to dwell in Chriſt, is to be conjoyned to him with an union conſtant and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall and mutuall betweene Chriſt and the beleever. As <hi>Cornelius Janſenius,</hi>

By this reaſon, the People might as wel for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare eating, and be contented that the Prieſt ſhould eate for them. For the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement for eating, in this place, is not more expreſſe than that of drinking.

               </p>
               <p>With the like licence they ſay that when Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Except ye eate my fleſh AND drinke my blood,</hi> this <hi>AND</hi> muſt be turned into <hi>OR,</hi> and that Chriſts meaning was to have ſaid, <hi>Except ye eat my fleſh, or drink my blood.</hi> If it may bee lawfull to change thus the words of the Lord, there is no law in the Scripture from which a man may not diſpence himſelfe. When the Law of God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands one to love God and his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, one may by the ſame reaſon ſay, that the Law meaneth that one muſt love God or his Neighbour: And when the Law ſaith <hi>Honor thy Father and thy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> it meaneth that one muſt honor his Father or his Mother, and that it is enough to honor either of them. Adde withall that by this depravation of the Lords Words, it followes that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may drink the Cup without eating the Hoſte, ſince it ſufficeth to do ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> That the principall Doctors of the Roman Church, yea the Popes themſelves do agree with us in this point: and hold that in the <hi>6.</hi> of S. Iohn nothing is ſpoken but of the ſpirituall Manducation, and that thoſe that contradict them, do ſpeake with incertitude.</head>
               <p>IN this controverſie we have the Popes for us, and a great multitude of the Romiſh Doctors, who hold with us that in the 6 of S. <hi>John,</hi> it is not ſpoken of the Euchariſt nor of eating our Saviour Chriſt by the mouth of the body, but that Chriſt ſpeaketh of the ſpirituall manducation by Faith in Chriſts death. Such is the opinion of Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the III, and of <hi>Pius</hi> II, called <hi>Aeneas Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi> afore he came to the Papacy.

Wilt thou know openly that the Evangeliſt ſpeaketh of the ſpirituall manducation which is made by Faith?

But if that hath reference to the Sacramentall manducation, there is ſome doubt in that which is ſaid; Except yee eate my fleſh, ye have no life in you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in this latter age the greateſt part of the Romiſh Doctors, eſpecially the Jeſuites, have forſaken this opinion, generally received in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in former Ages, and have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned the authority of the fore-allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Popes. Their opinion is, that in the 51 verſe of the 6 chap. of S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> Chriſt beginneth to ſpeake of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall manducation which is made by the corporall mouth: but that whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:59867:153"/>is ſaid before, is to be underſtood of the ſpirituall manducation. As when Chriſt ſaith in the 33, 35, &amp; 50 verſes <hi>that he is the bread come down from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> And <hi>that hee is the bread of Life.</hi> And that <hi>whoſoever beleeveth on him, ſhall never thirſt.</hi> And <hi>that he is the bread come down from heaven, whereof who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever eateth, hee ſhall not die.</hi> In all theſe places they grant that it is ſpoken of a manner of eating and drinking that is ſpirituall, and will have nothing there to be ſpoken of the bread of the Encha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, but do take all theſe words figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively. A doctrine truly full of abſurdity, and which deſtroyes and overthroweth it ſelfe. For what boldneſſe is it to forge in the ſequell or proſecution of one and the ſame diſcourſe, two kinds of mandu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and by a Maſter-like authority, to will that one part of the chapter be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood figuratively, and the other ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, ſince they all be the ſame kind of ſpeeches, and that the ſame expoſition may bee brought both to the one and to the other?</p>
               <p>The Councell of <hi>Trente</hi> was mightily peſtered about that; for after this matter had been toſſed a long time and diſputed upon at the Councell, the Prelats ſeeing
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:59867:153"/>the new Doctors were contrary unto the old, yea even to the Popes, and that the new ones beſides did not agree among themſelves, would determine nothing therein, and leſt the thing undecided, as <hi>Salmeron</hi> the Jeſuite, who was preſent at that Councell, doth teſtifie. <hi>The Synode</hi>

               <p n="1">1. They ſay that Chriſt ſp aketh in the future, ſaying, <hi>The bread that I will give,</hi> as ſpeaking of a manducation that was not yet.

               <p n="2">2. They ſay alſo that if this ſixth chapter of S. <hi>John</hi> were not taken and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of the manducation by the mouth of the body: it would follow that S. <hi>Iohn</hi> did not ſpeake at all of the Euchariſt. <hi>Stapleton,</hi> one of the moſt fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Adverſaries, anſwers for us: S. <hi>Iohn</hi> (ſaith he)<note n="*" place="margin">

                  <hi>writes nothing of the Euchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall Supper, becauſe the other three Evangeliſts had fully written of it before.</hi> S. <hi>John</hi> wrote long after the other Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, and did only inſiſt upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuch things as the others had omitted. He did not put in his Goſpel the hiſtory of the Lords Conception and Birth, nor of his Temptation in the Wilderneſſe, nor of his Baptiſme, nor of his Transfiguration in the Mount</p>
               <p n="3">3. They adde that Chriſt doth diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the eating from drinking, for to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne the two <hi>ſpecies</hi> of the Euchariſt. To that I anſwer, that Chriſt ſpeakes of eating and drinking, for to give us to underſtand that wee have in him and in his death a full and entire ſpirituall nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment. In the 55 chap. of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> 1. v.
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:59867:155"/>God inviteth the hungry and the thirſty to cate and to drink. And in the 22 of S. <hi>Luke,</hi> 30 ver. Chriſt ſaith: <hi>I appoint unto you a Kingdome, as my Father hath appointed unto me, that yee may eate and drink at my table in my Kingdom.</hi> In theſe places, our Adverſaries do acknowledge that to eate and to drink, ſignifies one and the ſame thing, and that they are taken in a ſpirituall ſenſe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But (ſay they) it is neither fitting nor convenient that Chriſt ſhould have uſed ſo many figures, and ſpoken in ſuch dark tearmes, when he might have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken plainely. Wee have already ſhewed that Chriſts ordinary uſe was to ſpeake unto the Jews by figures and ſimilitudes, and that the Capernaites, objecting unto him the bread of Heaven given by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> gave him occaſion to ſpeak ſo. That if our adverſaries do ſo much diſlike figures Why do they ſay that from the 27 verſe this chap. to the 51. the Lord ſpeaks of the ſpirituall manducation, and uſeth figurative words? Why will they have that when Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Except ye drink my blood: by drinking,</hi> he underſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth <hi>eating?</hi> That if the queſtion be touching the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, is there any thing in the World harder to conceive and to beleeve, than
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:59867:155"/>this doctrine, whereby they will have Chriſt to have eaten his own fleſh, and that an human body be whole and entire in every crum of the hoſt, and be remote and divided from it ſelfe, and that a Prieſt ſhould make a God with a few words, and that this god muſt run the riſque and be ſubject to be eaten by Rats and Mice, and carried away by the wind?</p>
               <p n="5">5. Yet (ſay they) Chriſt ſaid, <hi>My fleſh is me at indeed.</hi> Now, this word <hi>truly</hi> or <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,</hi> excludes all figure: For they eſteem that figurative words are not true. If it be ſo, why do they themſelves put in ſo many figures? Why will they have this word, <hi>bread,</hi> to be taken figuratively, and the word <hi>drinking,</hi> to ſignifie eating? They muſt then ſay that when Chriſt in the 15 of S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> 1 ver. ſaid, <hi>I am the true Vine,</hi> he ſpake falſly: or elſe they muſt needs grant that this word, <hi>true,</hi> excluds not the figure. So in the 8 to the <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. v. the Apoſtle calleth Paradiſe <hi>the true</hi> Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle.

               <p>Superſtition and Atheiſme are verie neere neighbours, and the one lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth unto the other. For frantick ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition intangles the minde with extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant conceits, that expoſe Religion to laughter, and make men to thinke that Religion is a ſhop of fables, and a meere imagination. Whence it comes to paſſe that thoſe that take upon them to defend Superſtition, let goe very often certaine words of impietie, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they profane the myſteries, and ſcoffe at their owne Religion under colour of defending it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Salmeron</hi> the Jeſuite, and Doctor <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> gives us an example thereof. This
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:59867:160"/>Jeſuite in the IX Tome and 26 Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, for to repreſent the manner and the end for which Chriſt gives us his fleſh to eate,<note place="margin">Sub finem Tractatus.</note> ſaith that Chriſt hath done as men doe, who for to kindle and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame a woman with love, doe give her an amorous potion or morſell, and that juſt ſo Chriſt in the Euchariſt gives to his Church <hi>Panis bucellam ſanctè bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictam &amp; incantatam, a morſell of bread holily bleſſed and INCHANTED for to tranſport her with his love.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Charron</hi> hath followed him, but with an addition that declares what are the ingredients of thoſe philters or amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous potions, to wit that there enters in them ſomething of the ſubſtance of the Lover, which ſubſtance is a thing not fit to be named. In his eighth Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the Euchariſt, after hee hath ſaid that God comes downe in the forme of bread and wine: and that to dance for to ſerue God, is leſſe ſtrange then what is done in the Maſſe: a little after, he declares how Chriſt communitates himſelfe unto men in the Euchariſt, to wit, that he allures and intices them with a dainty and delicious bit. <hi>Love</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is ſo ingenious and inventive, that for to win and allure the heart and will of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:59867:161"/>it hath found out a device to imploy inchanted morſels, philters and amorous po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and to make them to be taken and drunke by thoſe of whom one deſires to bee loved, in which morſells or potions enters ſome thing of the Lover or Suitor. Thus it ſeemes that God for to draw and allure un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himſelfe the heart and love of the Church, would preſent a bit or potion made of his ſubſtance in this Sacrament, the philter and amorous drinke of all Chriſtians, the dainty and delicious bit for to draw and allure them unto himſelfe.</hi> Doubtleſſe this man jeaſted and intended to make the world laugh, for he could not expect that men ſhould beleeve him.</p>

For Satan at the ſame time did labour and buſie himſelfe to introduce and bring into the Church theſe two ſorts of Idolatry.</p>
               <p>In the yeere of our Lord 754, the Emperor <hi>Conſtantin,</hi> ſon to <hi>Liſaurus,</hi> called a Councell of his whole Empire at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where 330 Biſhops were preſent, that condemned the ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Images. Among other reaſons that they bring, they exhort the people to be contented with thoſe Images that Chriſt had inſtituted, having given in the holy Supper the bread and wine for Images and Figures of his body and
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:59867:163"/>blood. And ſpeaking of the Euchariſticall bread, they ſay,<note n="*" place="margin">Ecce vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vificantis ill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <hi>Behold the image of this quickning body that is honorably preſented.</hi> And a little after, <hi>The Lord commanded to ſet</hi> [upon the table] <hi>that image altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther choſen, to wit the ſubſtance of the bread, leaſt Idolatry ſhould creep in if it were repreſented in an humane forme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But few yeares after, the Empire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fallen into the hands of <hi>Irenea,</hi> an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrous woman, and who did put out the eyes of her own ſon, and raviſhed the Empire from him: this monſter cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led another Councell at <hi>Nice,</hi> in the year 787. where ſhe cauſed Images to be re-eſtabliſhed, and the worſhipping of them to be commanded under paine of a curſe. There likewiſe were condemned as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominable, theſe foreſaid clauſes of the former Councell, whereby the bread and wine are called Images of the Lords body and blood. And it is the ſame Councell that declares, that Images are equivalent and of as much worth as the Goſpell: and that an Image is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than Prayer: And that Angels are corporall: And that he that hath the leaſt doubt whither Images muſt bee worſhipped, is accurſed. For certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſpirit of Satan reigned in that
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:59867:164"/>pernicious Councell. Wherefore alſo <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> who lived then, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led another Councell at <hi>Fran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>kford, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no Domini</hi> 794, in which that Councell of <hi>Nice</hi> was condemned as erroneous, by a generall conſent: notwithſtanding that Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> had approved that Councell, and made a Treatiſe in defenſe of it.</p>
               <p>Whileſt Satan beſtirred himſelfe thus in the Eaſt parts: the Roman Biſhops on their ſide did labour in the Weſt parts. For they did well perceive that theſe two things, to wit the adoration of the Sacrament, and the adoration of Images, would be of great uſe, and would ſerve much for the ſtrengthning of their Empire, and encreaſing of the dignity of the Romiſh Clergy. For the Pope taking out of the way the holy Scriptures from the eyes of the People, hat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>given them Images, which they call Ignorant mens Books, buſying the eyes of the people, whileſt he conveyed away the Word of God from them. And the opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the real preſence of Chriſts body in the Euchariſt, exalts the dignity and power of Prieſts, ſo far as to be able to make God with words, and to have Chriſt in their own power.</p>
               <pb n="300" facs="tcp:59867:164"/>
               <p>This abuſe, beginning to creepe in France, King <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Bald,</hi> about the yeere 870, made a commandement unto one <hi>Bertram</hi> a Prieſt, and as learned a man as theſe times did affoord, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and write a Book of this matter: which Book we have yet whole and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>x<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant at this day, wherein hee maintaines the true doctrine, and withſtands ſtoutly and vigourouſly that opinion of the reall preſence of the body of Chriſt under the ſpecies of the bread. For of Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation there was yet no ſpeech of it. For which cauſe alſo <hi>Bellarmin</hi> in his firſt Book of tee Sacrament of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, firſt chap. puts this <hi>Bertram</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Hereticks. Who not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, in his time, lived with honor, and was neither troubled, nor received any rebuke or reprehenſion upon this ſubject. Of the ſame opinion were <hi>Iohn Scotus</hi> and <hi>Drutmarus,</hi> and others of the ſame time. And I make no doubt but many others with them have defended the ſame cauſe in writing: But the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ages, in which error prevailed, have aboliſhed their writings, and it is marvel how this Book of <hi>Bertram</hi> could eſcape thus.</p>
               <p>The tenth and eleventh Ages, are the
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:59867:165"/>Ages wherein this error did ſtrengthen it ſelfe moſt, in which nevertheleſſe God left not himſelfe without teſtimony. For <hi>Bruno</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Angiers,</hi> and after him (but more vigorouſly) <hi>Berengarius,</hi> his Arch-Deacon, taught and maintained openly that the bread and wine of the Euchariſt were not the body of Chriſt, but the figure and remembrance of it:<note n="*" place="margin">Sigebert. ad annum 1051.</note> This <hi>Berangarius</hi> began to ſhew himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the yeare of our Lord 1050.

                  <hi>England</hi> ſuffered the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt and moſt ſhamefull ſervitude. That ſlavery increaſed eſpecially under the reigne of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond, and of <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> the third. In the yeare 1171.
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:59867:176"/>King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond for to expiate the crime whereof hee was accuſed, namely to have cauſed the murther of <hi>Thomas</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterburie,</hi> was whipt upon his naked fleſh by a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Monkes, ſome giving him three ſtripes and ſome five. With the like effeminatneſſe that King yeelded up to the Pope the Inveſtures of Benefices, which the Kings his predeceſſors had poſſeſſed till that time.</p>
               <p>That King being dead in the yeare 1189. had for Succeſſor <hi>Richard</hi> his ſon, and after him <hi>John,</hi> a King brutiſh and furious, who made ſome attempts to recover the Inveſtures which his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had yeelded up to the Pope. But being hated and contemned of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the third had a faire way to handle him ill. He did declare him to have loſt the right of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, diſpenſed his ſubjects from their Oath of allegiance, a thing never ſeene nor heard of before in <hi>England,</hi> cauſed Divine Service to ceaſe throughout all the Kingdom, and Churches and Church yards to be ſhut up: Which continued by the ſpace of ſix yeares and a halfe. He alſo excommunicated the King, and gave the Kingdome of <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Philip
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:59867:176"/>Auguſtus</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> upon condition to Conquer the ſame at his owne perill and fortune: and that for the remiſſion of his owne ſinnes.</p>
               <p>That conſtrained King <hi>John</hi> to yeeld up his Kingdome to the Pope, and to binde himſelfe to doe homage unto him for his crowne. So hee made himſelfe the Popes vaſſall, and <hi>England</hi> became Saint <hi>Peters</hi> patrimonie. And a Patent with a golden ſeale was made and fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, by which the King did oblige him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and his ſucceſſors for ever, to pay yearely unto the Pope a thouſand marks in gold, in ſigne of ſubjection, beſides Saint <hi>Peters</hi> moneys that were paid by polle. Unto which that poore King was forced to adde an Oath, whereby hee ſwore that hee was induced ſo to doe without conſtraint and of his owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, and by the motion of the holy Spirit: and that for the remiſſion of his ſinnes.</p>
               <p>Vnder this ſlaverie died this King in the yeare of our Lord 1216. to whom ſucceeded <hi>Henrie</hi> the third, who did put his Crowne at the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats feete, one knee upon the ground, doing homage unto him for his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>

<pb n="328" facs="tcp:59867:178"/>all theſe clamours were unprofitable and without effect, becauſe the holie Scripture was a Booke then altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unknowne amongſt the Engliſh people.

<pb n="329" facs="tcp:59867:178"/>of the Schoole of <hi>Prague,</hi> renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at that time.</p>
               <p>This <hi>John Huz,</hi> overcome by the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of <hi>Wickleſs</hi> reaſons, fell a preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his doctrine, and being a vehement and perſwaſive man, he drew after him a great number of People.

               <p>For to appeaſe theſe ſtirres and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions, the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Prague,</hi> called <hi>Subinco Cepus,</hi> cauſed <hi>Wicklefs</hi> Bookes publickly to bee burned, and drove out <hi>John Huz</hi> from <hi>Prague:</hi> But ſeeing the number of thoſe that he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led hereticks did encreaſe dayly, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe fled into <hi>Hongaria</hi> towards <hi>Sigiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond:</hi> and <hi>John Huz</hi> returned back to <hi>Prague.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then <hi>Benedict</hi> the thirteenth, &amp; <hi>Gregory</hi> the twelfth, excommunicated one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the one having his ſeat at <hi>Auignon,</hi> &amp; the other at <hi>Rome.</hi> A Councell was kept at <hi>Piſa</hi> in the yeare 1409. in which they

So there was then three Popes all at once, and there was no body in all the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> but was excommunicated by ſome one of theſe Popes.</p>

               <p>Grounded upon the Emperours faith and promiſe, they reſorted to the Councel and propounded their reaſons. They ſpake chiefly of the Communion under both kinds.

               <p>But the Emperour being irritated and angrie, came backe againe into <hi>Bohemia,</hi> bringing along with him two powerfull Armies, the one out of <hi>Germanie,</hi> and the other out of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garia,</hi> which like an overflowing tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, overwhelmed all <hi>Bohemia:</hi> Tooke ſome townes, and made great

               <p>
                  <hi>Ziſea</hi> being dead, <hi>Procopius</hi> ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him in the conduct of a part of the troopes, againſt whom Pope <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> the fifth ſet all <hi>Germanic</hi> in Armes, and ſent into <hi>Bohemia</hi> three mighty Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, commanded by the Dukes of <hi>Saxe,</hi> the Marqueſſe of <hi>Brandenbourg,</hi> and the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Trivers.</hi> Theſe three Armies joyned themſelves together. But ſo ſoone as the Bohemians did appeare, ſuch terrour and feare ſeiſed upon the Imperiall Armies, that they preſently fled without ſtaying for the enemie: forſaking all their baggage and muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of warre. But the Cardinal <hi>Julian,</hi>

This Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall entred into <hi>Bohemia,</hi> where hee committed many unheard off cruelties, killing both women and children<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But at the very firſt noyſe and rumour that came of the <hi>Bohemians</hi> approach, ſuch a terrible feare tooke this huge Armie, that every one threw his armes downe for to fly away more nimbly, and left their carriage and munitions of warre to the enemy.</p>
               <p>The Cardinall having eſcaped this danger, came to <hi>Baſile</hi> for to preſide at the Councell that the Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> the fourth had aſſembled there, in the yeare of our Lord, 1431.</p>

<pb n="343" facs="tcp:59867:185"/>of the Goſpell, than Battels; But I have repreſented this hiſtory, for to be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Gods juſtice, puniſhing the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyalty of <hi>Sigiſmond,</hi> who againſt his faith and promiſe burned alive two faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Martyrs, God having made uſe of weake and contemptible perſons for to make him loſe above two hundred thouſand men, and cover him with ſhame and confuſion.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>THis Prelate, in the ſeventeenth Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of his Confeſſion, altogether conformable to the Doctrine of our Churches, after he hath recited the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the holy Supper as it is found in the Goſpell, addeth:</hi> That is the ſimple, true, and lawfull Inſtitution of this admirable Sacrament, in the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration whereof wee doe confeſſe and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve the true and firme preſence of the Lord Chriſt Jeſus: Yet that preſence which faith offereth and makes preſent unto us: but not that which Tranſubſtantiation vainely invented, doth teach: For wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that the faithfull, in the holy Supper, doe eate the body of Chriſt Jeſus our Lord, not incruſhing and breaking it ſenſibly, and deſtroying it with our teeth, in the partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation: But in partaking thereof by the ſenſe
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:59867:186"/>of the ſoule. For the body of Chriſt is not that which is taken and ſeene in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the eyes, but that which Faith having taken ſpiritually makes it preſent and communicates it unto us. Therefore it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> that we eate it, and are made partakers of it, if we doe beleeve: But if we beleeve not, we fall away from all the benefit of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. By the ſame reaſon we beleeve that to drinke the Cup in the Sacrament, is to drinke indeed the blood of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, after the ſame manner as hath been ſaid concerning the body. For the Law-gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver made the ſame commandement touching his blood, as he did touching his body. Which precept muſt not be mutilated, according to every ones fancie and humour: But the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that hath beene preſcribed unto us, muſt be kept ſound and entire. When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the Sacrament wee have partaked worthily, and communicated intirely with the body and blood of Chriſt, we make this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, that we are already reconciled and united to our head, and made one and the ſelfe ſame body, with a firme hope that wee ſhall be his coheires in his Kingdome.</p>
